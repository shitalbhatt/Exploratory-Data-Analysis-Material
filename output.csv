"The staffs were phenomenal and super friendly with patients .Starting from the security at the entrance, who greet and offer their help to the patients is super comforting, the receptionists make things easier, nursing staffs were efficient and always available whenever you need them. Wish I could remember their names.The Doctor DEEPAK G SHIVARATHRE was very understanding and a very positive being, his expertise, willingness to listen and help, and to make sure patient is completely healthy . Another impressing thing was, -Doctor gave his personal number and was available when needed help with any queries.SHYAM the coordinator kept a track and got everything d1 till the post surgery visits .The insurance team got my work d1 hassle free.**Only negative is the pharmacy which is way time consuming for a single thing to buy.** I had to wait 15-20 mins to just pay m1y . It was difficult to stand with my operated painful leg. It was suppose to take a minute or 2 to make the payment.But overall happy as I was treated with respect and kindness at the Cytecare.Every1 in Cytecare deserve a recognition for your excellent attitudes and service.Hygiene is at priority in the hospital.Much obliged.",5

"Exceptional care and compassion from staff, who provided personalized attention throughout treatment. State-of-the-art facilities and comprehensive services. Accessible scheduling and seamless navigation within the hospital. Supportive environment with counseling and support groups available. Overall, a reassuring and positive experience during a difficult time.",5
"This hospital doesnt deserve the rating, just giving to post this and share my experience.I am deeply saddened to share my family's heartbreaking experience with Dr. Akshay's care. My father M.D Kumar, aged 65, underwent what was supposed to be a routine vocal cord laser surgery with confidence and a smile, trusting in the expertise and assurance provided by Dr. Akshay. However, following the procedure, he unexpectedly slipped into an unconscious state for approximately 4 months before passing away on February 5, 2024. Prior to this surgery, my father had no significant medical history aside from a stroke in 2008, from which he fully recovered within 2 years and lived a healthy, independent life without any complications. Despite the reassurances and numerical explanations provided by Dr. Akshay and his team, the devastating outcome leaves me questioning what went wrong. I implore any1 considering treatment under Dr. Akshay's care to exercise caution and thorough diligence. While success stories may be shared, it is imperative to inquire about any past failures or complications. This experience underscores the importance of advocating for 1's health and seeking transparency from healthcare providers. My hope in sharing this review is to encourage others to ask critical questions and prioritize their well-being before entrusting their care to Dr. Akshay or any medical professional. Attaching photos of my dad on the day he got admitted and the photos of him in the last days, ultimately he s no more but putting this up for others so that they do not lose their loved 1s by blindly trusting the doctors instead put 100 questions to them about the post effects.",1
"My experience at Cytecare Hospital surpassed all expectations as I had the pleasure of being treated by Dr Dr Akshaye Kudpaje and Dr. Suhag.M.S.From the skilled medical professionals to the comforting atmosphere, every aspect of my care was top-notch. I am forever grateful for the compassionate care I received and will always hold Cytecare in the highest regard.Miss Ruchiras kindness, professionalism, and attention to detail made a significant difference during a challenging time.",5

Top class treatment for the patients and the canteen also provides food for the attenders and visitors.Highly satisfied with the behaviour and service of canteen head Umesh.,5
"Rascal Dr Prasad Narayanan is 1 of the worst, dish1st, and corrupt doctors in this hospital.After being referred by Dr Poovamma C U to meet Dr Prasad for the next plan of treatment for my mothers breast cancer condition, this rascal doctor instilled a lot a fear in us and told us to get admitted immediately to the hospital for lung fluid tapping. This was totally unnecessary since radiation was going on and Radiation oncologist had clearly told us not to get any procedure d1 during radiation. This cheap and m1y minded Dr Prasad also recommended Chemotherapy which was totally not a right approach since my mother was Her2 -ve and other better approaches are currently available which this ignorant and pathetic doctor is not aware of.Though the hospital premises and facilities are hygienic and to international standards, this hospital consists of some inexperienced, not patient centric, and unemphathetic doctors.My request to all the patients - Please take a second opinion, dont blindly believe these doctors who force you to get treatments just to follow the hospital protocol and meet the hospital revenue targets. Unfortunately, We are in a sad and corrupt state of medical world today.",1

"I was diagnosed with Non Hodkins Lymphoma Stage 4 at Cytecare Hospital in 2020, and after the first treatment, I was in remission, but I had a relapse in 2023.Dr. Prasad Narayanan took my case and diagnosed the relapse and handled it with utmost expetise, professionalism, and care.After chemotherapy, I was advised by Prasad Sir to do autologous B1 Marrow Transplant, and as a result, I am in remission.I am grateful to the oncology, surgery, BMT, nursing and cleaning departments, and the staff involved for being supportive throughout the process. Special thanks to Anisha Ma'am, sisters Harshita, Mercy, Samreen, Ashwini, and brothers Suman and Vijay.The doctors on call at the In Patient care carried out the protocols to the letter and went above and beyond their duty to help me during the hardships of chemotherapy, including it's side effects, complications, physical and mental trauma.Most hospitals see their patients as ATM machines and exact as much as possible, and even then, provide minimal care. 1 of them is Manipal at HAL Airport road where Dr. Asish Dixit is head of Oncology. I would suggest all cancer patients stay clear of this doctor and hospital. However, at Cytecare, the treatment and care are reasonably priced, and patients and their family's voice is heard, and necessary actions are taken by the management.As far as criticism goes for Cytecare, I would only suggest increasing discipline in the Surgery and BMT nursing staff. I experienced some lapses during my treatment, which caused unnecessary complications and could have been avoided if hospital protocols were followed. The other is to have more vegetarian options in the cafeteria for BMT patients as they have no contact from the outside world during their stay. It may look like a tantrum, but patients in BMT are physically traumatized and can only eat according to their pallette. At the same time, they need nourishment to increase their vitals. I hope these changes are made so other BMT or surgical patients have a smoother experience.Overall, Cytecare Hospital is a well-oiled machine, and the exchange of information in different departments is smooth and less complicated, which is helpful, especially for cancer patients and their families.I am thankful to Cytecare Hospital for being a hospital where the hospital policy is to accept cancer patients at any stage and try their best to send them back to their normal life.I am indebted to Dr. Prasad Narayanan, his team of doctors, all nurses, and the rest of Cytecare staff, and have nothing but gratitude for giving me a second chance at life.",5
Excellent consultation,5
Very good treatment services,5
"Very good Hospital with Excellent doctors and treatment. Supporting staff are too good. The hospital atmosphere is admirable, very clean and well maintained. Hospitality and care is superb.",5
Had really good experience with Cyte care hospital. My mom was admitted to get her cancer treated. Every person working there greets patient with care and service rendered is fast enough from lab services to in patient services. Had good experience with Neethi who is working under Dr.Poovamma. Neethi had given all necessary details needed during the course of treatment and regularly followed up with patient about treatment and services. Shes always available for any queries and patiently addressed the questions. My heart full thanks to 1 and all who supported my mom well during her hospital stay.,5
Good experience,5
"This is the best hospital i have ever been, you more feel like home caring than hospital. Starting from reception during admission, staff, nurse (especially Abhinandan - He is such an humble and caring nurse, he treated my dad with so much of caring) and all the nurse staff who treated by Dad. My dad is diagnosed by lung cancer with 4th stage which is very difficult to recover. Appreciate the way Dr. Prasad Narayan and Dr. Girish understood the multiple issues he is going through, especially Dr. Prasad Narayan the way he patiently explains the cause, being frank on what is expected and how we need to be prepared for coming days. Any1 can give wrong hope but being frank and providing the fact in very humble way, is not with every doc. I would suggest and strongly recommend for any1 who is suffering with cancer to visit this hospital where u dont have to worry and every staff will make u feel u at home than hospital. Pray for my dad to sleep with ease and thanks to all the wonderful people and doctor for taking care of my dad.",5

Becoz lots of unwanted things they add in bills. Actually medicine given for the patient will be not even 20 percent of the bill amount.The charges will be all useless things other than medicine.Please dont choose this hospital. Instead try hospitals such as HCG or Manipal. For better price for same treatment.",1

"At first, I had my doubts on the extremely high ratings of the hospital. However, as the attender of a loved 1 fighting cancer, I can say that choosing Cytecare was 1 of the best decisions. Pretty much the entire staff - doctors, nurses, procedures team, insurance helpdesk, housekeeping, cafeteria, radiology, pathology - they're all extremely helpful, courteous, n have very good expertise in their fields. The processes are very streamlined n smooth for the most part, n wait times are minimal. Our family is very lucky to have Cytecare's team with us in fighting cancer. I wish the hospital n its entire staff my best compliments in its operations.To cancer patients - since the crowding in Cytecare is minimal, the chances of infection at hospital premises are pretty less ...this is an important factor while choosing a hospital. Its an excellent hospital for cancer treatment.",5

"1. Cytecare is great for Cancer treatment & Surgeries.2. Dr. Poovamma is an extraordinary breast cancer doctor who excels not only in her medical expertise but also in her instantly approachable personality. From the moment we met her, she made us feel comfortable and supported us throughout our breast cancer treatment journey. Her remarkable knowledge and willingness to patiently address all my questions and concerns were truly reassuring. Dr. Poovamma's compassionate and approachable nature sets her apart as a healthcare professional. I am incredibly grateful for her outstanding care and would wholeheartedly recommend her to any1 in need. She truly is a real-life superwoman, indeed!3. Dr. Aditya Naragund provided exceptional care and expertise in the treatment of hernia, and I deeply appreciate his skillful and compassionate approach throughout the entire process.4. A big shoutout to Nurse Saurav, whose passion for his job really amazed me! His dedication and genuine care made a significant difference. Thank you, Nurse Saurav, for your outstanding commitment to patient well-being!5. However, the hospital urgently needs to address and rectify the shortage of duty doctors, nurses and caretakers in post-surgery care to ensure a more balanced and inclusive healthcare environment. I really felt they were overworked as they couldn't respond to patient calls immediately few times.6. And lastly the hospital should consider enhancing and expediting their discharge procedures to ensure a smoother transition for patients leaving their care.",4

"Our experience at Cytecare was above our expectations. We hadnt heard of the hospital before which made us very reluctant and unsure of our decision to get the treatment there. However, we were surprised to see well organized the entire system was at the hospital. From the cleanliness, to staff, waiting times to ease of payment, everything went really smooth.As we started the treatment at the hospital Ms.Rekha took time out to make sure we were comfortable starting our treatment in the hospital.I would like give a special shout-out to Akshita who supported us in every possible way throughout our treatment at the hospital, from day 1 until we finished. She went our of her to help not only us but all the patients that would come in. She was very flexible and made sure the patients health and wellness came first.Radiation is something my mom was very scared about but The radiology technician Naveen made things so comfortable and easy for her. His jovial nature really put a smile on moms face helping her get over her fear. Ashwini was understanding and always made sure mom was comfortable before getting into the radiation room. Pre- radiation routine was d1 by Jayalakshmi who brightens up moms mood with her smile and joyous approach.Both the doctors we interacted with- Dr.Prasad Narayan ( our medical oncologist) and Dr.Surendra Reddy ( our radiation doctor) took time out to explain all the procedures to us and made sure we were comfortable before we started.In the chemo department, I would like to mention Madhu who was so patient and understanding during he chemo sessions.Overall our experience was very good and I would definitely recommend this hospital to others !",5

The hospital staff seemed genuinely invested in the well-being of every individual, making sure they were attended to promptly and with utmost care.While all the staff members were commendable, I must give special recognition to Ms. Neethi who went above and beyond to assist my family and me. Her dedication and willingness to go the extra mile left a lasting impression on us. I must say her professionalism and cooperative nature made the process much smoother, and I am grateful for all the assistance she provided.Overall, my experience at the hospital was beyond satisfactory as of now. I left with a sense of gratitude for the exemplary care I received during my time there and also hope to continue the same for my upcoming visits .

You can feel it as you enter the hospital. Every single staff member be it Security Guard or Lift Man or Nurses or Doctor, every1 is extremely polite & emphatic. The entire aura of place is very positive which gives you hope.On my day 1 at hospital I met a lady whose mother got cured and had come for final checkup. She came here when all other hospitals had refused to treat her citing her fragile health.We interacted with Dr. Akshay & Dr. Harish. Both are extremely knowledgeable.

Appointment team is not suppose to comfirm any appointment with a specialist Dr if Dr is not available and patient is sent to other Dr who does not have proper knowledge about the desease.In your hospital appointment time has no meaning.

"""I am sure all the good ratings they are showing are the paid 1s, 'coz i have had the worst experience of my life here. Also anybody who is digital savvy can make out if a """"hospital"""" has got aprox 5/5 ratings overall then it has to be only the paid 1s.The doctors are non-contactable for any emergency situation even you are undergoing a treatment thereThe doctors prescribe the further treatment while the second opinion in the other good hospitals says the treatment d1 so far was not effectiveThe doctors just bother about their treatment and would take no call for even any serious side effects you may have coz of their treatmentThey are just for m1y minting and i am sure the doctors lack the empathy and required knowledge .Would NOT recommend any1 to go and waste their precious time there",more so when time is more important for your family members."

"A hospital with well trained, hard working, polite, kind hearted and helpful staff. This was for my fathers tounge cancer treatment, I searched many hospitals and zeroed on Cytecare. I was bit skeptical initially but wanted to take a chance after reading a lot of reviews on Dr. Akshay and the hospital. This turned out to be 1 of the finest decisions. Half the worry went away after my first meeting with the doctor whos is a gentleman par excellence. I must say all the admirations for the nursing staff would fall short for the kind of support they provided during the post surgery stay in the hospital. I mist salute the selfless support of the security head who pitched in like an angel to help fix my car which I realised at the time of discharge that 1 of its tyre has g1 flat. In no time he intervened and got this fixed. The 1 thing which differentiates compared to others is the kind of people who are working in this hospital. You can have a good infra but you need the right type of people to run it well. Thanks Cytecare and its staff. BTW It is NOT a paid review.",5
Nice hospital,5
Excellent treatmentWell maintained cleanliness. Very polite staffs.,5
Excellent service by the doctor and staff,5
Was advised to go to Cyte care for my master health check up. Was not sure but after visiting to check out the place I was very impressed. Tests were d1 methodically and Padma assisted me and my daughter in going from 1 testing room to the other very efficiently with no confusion. Waiting time was less and the whole place is swanky clean. The hospital is not overcrowded which is a big relief too. Breakfast needs improvement. All the staff lift men / doctors/ lab techs / Dietician and reception staff smile and help you . Cyte care was a very pleasant experience!! Hope its always so..,5

This is my first visit to the hospital I had a very good experience with the hospital.

"I am Ramanatha Rao from Bengaluru. Recently shifted to North Bengaluru and I am now going to Cytecare for my treatment for thyroid carcinoma. So far, I have only been there only a few times for consultations and check-ups. Since I had it get a PET-CT d1, I visited the Nuclear Medicine unit and found every1 there very efficient and helpful. The staff there were pleasant and well organized. They knew exactly what needed to be d1 and they did it with a smile. I found the staff there, to name a couple of them Ms Rajani at the NM unit reception and Ms Maheeb (not sure if I got the spelling right) at the dispensing unit were great in making my visit a pleasant 1. Dr GRM Reddy was simply great as he summarised for me the results of the PET-CT. Even with my limited experience, I can not but place on record the efficiency with which the hospital works. I found Dr Prasad Narayan, a Medical Oncologist very thorough and fully informed about my condition in just a couple of visits. He is very tough and friendly. My visits to him were efficiently assisted by Ms Kavya, the patient care staff. Dr Narayan quickly assessed my condition and drew a treatment plan for the next 6 months.In addition to the high level of professional knowledge and skills that support all quality medical care, the team of doctors was very empathetic, helpful and calm when dealing with the questions. The facility is well-maintained, clean and pleasing. I found no cluttering and hence it reflected the efficiency with which medical care was provided at Cytecare. The only blemish, if 1 could call it that, is it could do better on the food outlet for outpatients, although appreciate its efforts in running small food and beverage outlets managed by differently baled persons.",5

"This hospital charges 3-10 times more m1y from the patient as per patient economic condition. They first trap the patients, then start extorting m1y.Another hospital asked me for treatment cost of 2.5 lacs, when I called cetecare hospital they said the same cost but when I admitted the patient then they took 6 lacs. They didn't inform the estimate cost. Before discharge the patient they force to give 5 star rating in Google and papers. It's great scam.",1

"Cytecare hospital in Bengaluru is 1 of the best hospitals I have visited. All the way from Africa and I can attest that it is the best. From how they coordinate on how you are going to get to hospital, Personally I would like to thank Mr Ganapati for making sure we got to the hotel and connecting us to Ms Ruchira Das who helped us dearly in navigating the hospital and booking our appointments with the doctors. Mr Ganapati kept on following as well and helping us where we needed help. We are truly grateful.Cytecare got us from the airport, took us to the hotel and On the day of going to hospital they book us a cab to hospital and from the hospital back to the hotel so we didn't have to worry about transport.In the hospital we met wonderful staff from the time of arrival to the time of our leaving. Ms Ruchira on our day of arrival welcomed us very well and she took her time to explain everything on the treatment procedure and financial sector and on booking our appointments to see various doctors.. the doctors were very good and they did everything from the heart and the passion on their work could be seen..Once the tests were d1, the patient was advised by Doctor shreyas N who is a urologist in the hospital on how the situation was to be handled. He as well took his time to explain to us on what the patient had and on what the solution was.We went ahead with the doctor's advice and thankfully there was a slot for surgery the following day.. some tests were d1 just to make sure the patient was fit for surgery ( something that made me confident with the surgery)The surgery was d1 and the patient was admitted.The wards there are very clean and the staff in that sector are very wonderful and friendly. They made sure our stay there was awesome and we definitely felt at home that the patient recovery was fast.The doctors who did her surgery were incredible and I truly appreciate them.1. Doctor Mohan2. Doctor Shreyas3. Doctor Chetan - who kept on checking on the patient progress since the day of admission to her discharge day, we are very grateful doc.I would like to mention Bhagya L for her incredible care on the patient she became the patient favourite that they exchanged contacts??, and all the caregivers in the hospital.I would love to appreciate the following people for their services.- Mrs Pranita - there's no day that passed by without her coming to check on how we are doing and to ask whether we had any complaints ( of which we didn't have??) we really enjoyed her company as other times we could chat on things that are not hospital related we even forgot we were in hospital. Thank you so much Mrs Pranita??.- Every Nurse that came to help the patient we are greatful like Rajaram, Simi,Ashwini and others that I don't rem their names.- Dietrician department was awesome, the food was very good and came on time.- Security team, thank you so much and most of all Mr Bikash Powdel who picked us from the airport and everytime we visited the hospital he was always helpful. Thank you.- The cleaning department for making sure our room was ever clean.- The physiotherapist was awesome and everytime the patient was longing for massage and especially the back massage, Thank you.As a caregiver I never got bored once been in the hospital, the hospital took care of me as their own and I truly appreciate.I could write a book on how incredible this hospital is but for now let me finish by saying that every1 in the family is grateful on your services Cytecare.I would 100% recommend Cytecare hospital",5

"I am a student of Vidyashilp Academy Bangalore. I went to Cytecare for an observership for 3 days. There, I learned about how different departments work in a hospital.I would like to start by mentioning about how clean and maintained the hospital was. H1stly, I was really fascinated by the cleanliness I got to experience there. It was very outstanding!Secondly, I want to highlight the staff at Cytecare. They were always motivated to not only help patients but also talk about what they do every day. Due to this, I got to learn a lot about the importance of doctors. In spite of me only being a visitor to the hospital, I got answers to all my questions. The answers I received were very appealing to me as a student due to the fact that the doctors were very simple with their explanations and very congenial. 1 thing I want to emphasize here is that the doctors not only briefed me about what they did, but also let me interact with real stakeholders, like blood donors!During 1 of my visits to Cytecare, I got to interact with a little girl named, Tejashree. Tejashree, had leukemia when I got to interact with her. However, Tejashree has recovered and is in remission as of now. The reason I thought of mentioning this is because Tejashree was a girl with not many privileges. Cytecare, knowing this, still treated her with an amazing effort.All in all, I want to say, what Cytecare does, is, in my opinion, God's work of helping people without bias. This, in my point of view, shows actual compassion and love for humanity.",5

"This is Himadri Sen. I've been getting treatment at Cytecare, Bengaluru, for my metastatic Adenocarcinoma of Lungs (stage IV) since last 4 years under the care Dr. Harish P.My experience at Cytecare is very good and I thought of sharing it, for the benefit of all.At Cytecare, I found the inter-deparmental coordination is really great. All the staffs are cordial, polite and professional.During last 4 years, I had to undergo so many X-rays, Pet-CTs, blood tests, Chemos, and I find a very high level of coordination, time bound procedures and very personal level approaches, which was really helpful for me, in planning as well as saving time, and definitely saving m1y in the process.I want to thank each and every1 out here at Cytecare, for the support they have given from the department of security, reception, radiology, billing, laboratory, day-care, out-patient co-ordinators and all.Dr.Prasad Narayanan is very good and supportive.I will fall short of words when it comes to Dr. Harish P., who's such a cool, sharp and accommodating Medical-Oncologist, I have ever met. He has been immensely supportive and a guiding light for me. On 11th-July-2018, I along with my family met him first at Cytecare and almost after an hour-long hearing about my personal details, he told us that 1 of my EGFR mutation will definitely come positive. Then on in every step he has been very prompt, supportive and tolerating. He's really a Gem.In my opinion at Cytecare you get services which can be at par with the best standards in the field of Oncology.I had a couple of sessions with the wellness program and over there Ms.Mili Baruah is great, thorough and very helpful.My thanks and regards to 1 and all.",5

"I'm a doctor of pharmacy graduate from KCOP interning at Bangalore Baptist Hospital.3 of us interns had attended the Cancon conference on Head and Neck Oncology and Transoral Laser microsurgery held at Cytecare Hospital with Day1 of didactic lectures and live surgeries by Dr Carsten Palme from Sydney, Australia in the presence of Dr Akshay Kudpaje and the entire team of Anaesthesia headed by Dr Dinesh Raju also involving some insights from Dr Ashok Shenoy ,Dr Nanjundappa, Dr Purushotham Chavan, Dr A S Arvind and their personal experiences. Didactic lectures were also given by Dr Shashikant, Dr vidyadharan, Dr sivkumar Dr shantanu and so many others.Day 2, the didactic lectures were given by Dr Komal and Dr Sudha. And Dr Sudhas' model for laryngoscope was very fascinating and commendable.Cyte care is also offering hands on sessions to surgeons for almost 3 hours which is the kind of exposure that usually isn't offered by any of the other cancer hospitals. Prof.Carsten was very friendly and approachable and his good sense of humour made the whole live surgery experience fun and less distressing. Even Dr Vidyadharan's and Dr Purushotham's sessions were very interesting and lively. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and it would've been a huge miss if I hadn't attended. Really appreciate the efforts by Cytecare and for the kind of quality healthcare they are providing. The hospitality and grace with which they pulled off the whole event is also very appreciable. The infrastructure of Cytecare and well as the staff are very pleasing and welcoming. The overall experience was highly satisfactory and heart warming.",5

"I am sharing the wonderful experience we had in Cytecare hospital, Bangalore recently when my wife got knee joint replacement surgery by Dr. Gururaj Puranik.Initially we had some apprehension of about getting the knee joint replacement surgery in a cancer specialised hospital and which also was relatively far for people living in south Bangalore. However based on the assurance given by doctor/ surgeon Gururaj Puranik and our confidence in him made use to check it out.I would say right from the security guards, reception and admin staff, coordinators, doctors, physicians, ICU, nursing, helpers and housekeeping were very friendly and highly professional. Hospital is clean & modern and I felt that their charges were reasonable. The operation went on well and the excellent post operative care helped my wife to recover fast and got discharged within 5 days after both knee got operated.The discharge and bill settlement including insurance claim etc was smooth. In summary I would say this was my best experience in any hospital so far. And I learnt that though it is a cancer speciality hospital we can get best services in all other areas as well.",5

I am taking time to write this review to share my thoughts and experience my family and I have been through during the last 1.3 years when he was diagnosed with skin cancer in an advanced stage and was treated at Cytecare Cancer Hospital, Yelahanka.Our life changed the day we got to know about his condition. 1 thing that kept us going strong amidst all the uncertainty was the timely advice, support and unconditional care from the hospital staff. I cannot thank enough Dr. Prasad Narayan, Dr. Harshapriya and Dr. Akshay Kudpaje. Knowing that every decision to be taken is critical, we were completely dependent on the advise from these doctors. The reason my brother in law was with us for almost a year even though his condition was extremely worse was because of the motivation, care and positivity given to him by each of them. Special thanks to Dr. Harshapriya for her immense support. During his last weeks, the most critical thing for us was the preparation mentally! Every time I had a conversation with Dr. Harshapriya, she understood our situation, probably repeated her advise multiple times as we kept asking out of concern. She was a great support and cannot thank her enough. Thank you Dr. Harshapriya.All the staff including nurses, facilities, security, pantry and billing - were supportive and empathetic.THANK YOU!!!",4

"Have had a very pleasant experience at Cytecare Cancer Hospitals, Bengaluru. The first visit for tests and enquiries about treatment procedures was handled very professionally. The subsequent visit for a multi-day treatment was equally easy for the patient. Not even once did we have a chance to complain. Everything is so well handled out here. The ever-present-smiles on the faces of the staff here, eager-to-help attitude, always-enquiring-on-how-to-improve are a welcome change compared to other hospitals in the city. Dr. Ajay Rao and Dr. Harish are so very knowledgeable, approachable and pleasure-to-talk-to. Interactions with them instills new confidence in the patient. The administration staff here are equally professional in how they handle patients' needs. Also a special thanks to akka Jayamma who has been courteous to spend an extra minute or 2 to even enquire and strike a conversation with the patient to help them feel better. I wholeheartedly recommend this hospital without any hesitation.",5

"My dad was diagnosed with Mouth Cancer and upon first detection, we headed straight to TMC, Mumbai. Upon arriving at Tata memorial hospital, you see all that is wrong with this disease. We needed urgent treatment and without giving much thought, we came to Bangalore. Cytecare Hospital was 1 of the 2 choices we had for my Dad's surgery. Dr. Akshay's humbleness is what made us come here. Our experience was great until things started to complicate post surgery.A lot of things went wrong in which there were things that the doctor could have handled better and a few things that happened just due to bad luck.A special shoutout to 2 nurses: Nurse Ruby and Shiny for being extra caring and being really good human beings. Patient care staff was also really kind to us and prompt.It is a modern new hospital but majority of the staff is a bit inexperienced. If you think your case is a complicated case requiring complex surgery, I would say kindly opt for a different hospital but for other cases, this is a great choice.",5

A doctor should come to conclusion only after the final draft is ready and he sholud corroborate with other report and reach out to a conclusive conclusion.

"We had a PET CT Scan d1 recently for my mother...Savithry P....aged 72 yrs....at your hospital and the experience was totally heart warming....We reached the hospital around 8.30 as Amma's procedure was scheduled around 8.45....the entire procedure was explained to us very clearly and then Amma had to change her into her gown for the procedure and I had to wait outside in the waiting area till the procedure was over....It took roughly around 2 hours for the procedure to get over...by then Amma had severe headache and nauseating feeling....even though they doctor had asked her to have some kind of liquid she was not able to do so because of the headache and nauseating feeling...The doctors and the nursing staff and the helping staff were very helpful and allowed Amma to take rest by lying down in the post operative bed to take rest till such time that she was feeling better....Amma had a bad headache so I ran to the pharmacy in the first floor to see if I could get some kind of balm to apply on her forehead....they did not have it in stock but the kind pharmacist girl (I am sorry i i forgot to ask her name in all that tension) was of great help gave me the balm that she had in her purse and helped me at that moment...thank you so much dear ????....Then after applying the balm Amma got some relief and after a few moments she vomitted completely....meanwhile all this while sister Mercy was keeping round the clock check on Amma so once Amma vomitted ...doctor also came and gave her an injection to make her feel better....after she got the injection and proper rest of about another half an hour Amma started feeling better...her headache also reduced and her nauseating feeling also reduced...she then had some water initially to check if she would vomit again...then after about 10 mins had some juice and then after another gap of 10 mins had some curd rice because by then it had become 12.30 in the noon and Amma had started to feel really hungry as she had been fasting from the previous night...We came home once she was feeling better and had her food??This was just a small experience shared by me...her daughter....Thanking all the doctors and nursing staff, sister Mercy and the pharmacy girl in particular ....thank you for this wonderful experience.RegardsPriya.",5

"Definitely 1 of the best hospitals in Bangalore among all categories, not just cancer treatment. Doctors are very understanding and flexible which makes it less traumatic for the patient. Nursing staff are also excellent. Their processes seem to well integrated for a superior experience overall - for the patient and the caretaker as well. Giny Alias from the Patient Experience dept was super effective and helpful in addressing certain urgent needs, such as getting a room assigned after ICU, and enabling proper Wifi for my long stay as a caretaker, and other support. She coordinated and ensured the requests were completed to satisfaction, and kept in touch constantly, and checked in on us regularly.Ask for her by name!Every single staff member even security and patient care is courteous, respectful, upbeat and genuinely helpful towards patients and their families. People make all the difference, and Cytecare is a fantastic example of strong ethos, management and operational excellence. Keep it up.P.S Food is good too :-)",5

"Seems too many fake reviews or review on looks. Hospital has a horrible culture of deceiving patients for m1y. 1 doctor said pet ct not required or useful but another doctor any way did and billed to hospital. Doctor are the worst part than treatment. They focus is only on your m1y, not on your treatment. I have experienced first hand how they manipulate for treatment without any accountability with fear and near death talk, eliminating all other options except what they say. When I checked outside hospital many options are available. They are first interested in your income, first thing they ask is about your job. If no then they make a note in prescription and pass to hospital and insurance team to silently handle. Why such stupid doctor even a doctor. This is true for Dr. Prasad Narayana. These doctors are worst than butchers. Atleast butchers are h1y. These docyors lying, deciving and risking our lives for thier m1y in name of such a mazing profession. There is silent psychology department who creeps in to make m1y in patient desperate state. May be they share how can they share patient misery in cafeteria sipping a coffee to make m1y. Like group of hygenes eating a deer 1 after the other. Reply- how can u find in system if I did not mention my name here. I dont trust your hospital. Want to know more. Post your email id not nimber.",5
Dr Harish and Jithin has been exceptional in the way they have handled us as clients.. It's the best experience for some1 who goes through difficult times in a cancer hospital.

"Definitely a corporate hospital but more like mechanic store. We will give treatment if might work for 80% they say without any data. Like a mechanic say, we will change parts if problem comes, bring back the vehicle. Doctors especially in oncology does not have depth of research or knowledge they just act like mechanics. Not happy with Dr. PRASAD Narayana. He seems lost touch with medice and humans, talks like a robot, works like MBA management guy, deceiving answers. Says something, writes something not relevant in prescription. Comes across a knowledge but only untill u ask few questions he does not seems to have answers. He even lied insurance does not cover certain treatment but it is covering for me when I got it from outside.This hospital team and insurance team is nothing less than faurd. Don't trust what they say. They made me to pay by deceiving which could have covered in insurance which I did in other hospitals. There is lot of worst experience but cannot put all in review very gory, inhuman, m1yinding, lying and deciving method hospital uses.",5

Now they come back with advice of taking injection in daycare(which can be taken at any clinic after dr consultation also) but doctor will meet post that only. They don't value for your time and m1y.This is not the first experience I had today, these has been same for all the visits(have visited twice). We run after doctors with expectancy of being cured and treat them as God but they run business...worst experience ever",5

"This hospital uses discriminatory statements towards patients. I was very shocked that not 1 but 2 of the lead doctors in the gynecologist office were told of issues that linked to stress and were completely ignored because they'd look at the weight of the person over the actual health issue.Research has�consistently shown�that healthcare professionals are biased against people deemed as having overweight or obesity. This causes them to behave in discriminatory ways, such as blaming serious health issues on weight and, therefore, inadvertently ignoring other possible causes.However, weight is just 1 of many factors affecting health. Also, the link between weight and health does not run in 1 direction. A persons health can affect their weight, just as their weight can affect their health. Beliefs about people who carry excess weight often ignore this fact.I will not be returning to this hospital ever again. When some1 is unwell and seeking help the should not be attacked and demonized over weight.",5

"5 stars is falling short to describe my experience with Cytecare. Every1 expected that I will panic and be depressed ever since the diagnosis. As a Hospital Cytecare is standing still with me, supporting me and in various ways 'you' have helped me, throughout the treatment. Exactly a year ago I was diagnosed with Cancer. The sense of being in safe hands, made me stronger. Doctors explained stages of treatment and lifestyle which helped me make quick decision. I didn't have to worry that my family was away, every staff, right from security till our doctors, made me feel that I am not fighting this al1. 'Thank you' is a smallest word to describe my gratitude for Cytecare. Excellent Doctors, especially Dr. Prasad Narayan, Dr. Ajay Rao, Dr. Poovamma Dr. Harish, Dr. Suhas and all the Surgical Registrars. I have visited other hospitals, but the nursing care is Indescribable, they are dedicated and focused on patients. Patient services and billing team is very good. A special thanks to Mr. Manujeeth who helped in the Insurance processing. My sincere thanks to Ms. Liscy Varghese and Ms. Monika Singh for emotionally and morally being there for me. I am happy I made the right decision to get treated at Cytecare. I definitely would recommend this hospital. Thank you Cytecare.....",5
"Hospital looks clean, inexperienced doctors are there,also it is very expensive.Don't ever go to this hospital in the name of consultation & surgeries They will loot people in the name of plastic reconstruction surgery, even if it is not needed.Doctors will experiment with the patients, putting patients to all kinds of risks.For doctors consulation better go to HCG & Shankara Cancer hospital.For tests go to HCG hospital, it is the best hospital for all kind of cancer tests ie scanning, blood tests, ECG, echo etc .Don't ever come to this hospital.",5
I had consulted Dr.srinivasan regarding clarification for my daughter's illness at Singapore. He was patiently listen to us and he answered all our questions. He understood the trauma we are going through and gave all answers . It was very pleasant to interact with him. More importantly the call was on time and was coordinated by Rani,5
"Cytecare is easily 1 of the best oncology hospitals in India. Dr. Prasad is 1 gem of a person and an excellent Oncologist. In order to be a good doctor, the doctor should have enough qualifications, experience and, an approachable persona. Dr. Prasad has all the makings and qualities of a good and friendly doctor. My mother is suffering from stage-4 cancer and is being treated wonderfully. She is responding well to the treatment and recovering rapidly. The team instills good hope in the patient and the family. The hospital consists of an excellent team of Doctors, Therapists, Nurses, and helpers etc who ensures maximum support. Rubaina and Vani are excellent coordinators to communicate the essential information with the patients family and the doctors. The treatment is relatively cheaper for the best of class treatment they have offer. They are among the very few Healthcare facilities, where the team of doctors are not bugged by the commercial exploitation of the modern world. Highly recommend this hospital for all the stages of Cancer.",5

I was severe in pain but they cautiously took me to the OT and cured me off. I didn't feel any horrible pain after the surgery. The dieticians often comes and asks me what I need and they provided me with fruits and food as per the timing.The staffs there treated me with a smile. The doctors distracted me enough to make my pain reduce while dressing the wound. I absolutely feel wonderful now thanks to Cytecare Hospitals.,5

"Let me take this opportunity to whole heatedly thank the Cytecare Cancer hospital for the wonderful care I received while under treatment. I was scared of the cost but I found it managable. Allow me to single out Dr. Prasad Narayanan, Dr. Harris Prassad and Harris Menon among other doctors for their humility in attending patients. When I was very low Dr. Prasad Narayanan kept on assurering me while he visited me at the wards. The international patients team of Brother Yusuf Mohammed, Lydiah and the young Lady Jai your coordination was excellent,timely and precise. You did your best to make sure we had means to attend all sessions in time. I will not forget the team of nurses who attentively did their best to give us the nursing care we needed. Among them I recognized Grazi her motherly touch was wonderful in the ayes of many. Surely you need more space than this to tell of the goodness in Cytecare. May Our Almighty enable you to continue the services you are rendering.JOSEPHAT OGUTU ABISAI -KENYA",5
Good Place with best doctors,5
"Extremely happy with the entire experience at Cytecare where my father is undergoing treatment. My experience with hospitals in India so far had been pretty unimpressive, to say the least. This has been a welcome exception. The first thing that strikes you is the cleanliness and attention to hygiene. The staff here are extremely competent, polite and professional. They have best of the doctors and state of the art equipments. The care and compassion, which is an integral part of therapy in Oncology, is palpable in all interactions with the doctors, nurses, nutritionists and administrative staff at the hospital. I would highly recommend Cytecare over other institutions that specialise in Cancer treatment, we had tried a few in Bangalore and Calcutta before this.",5

It is very difficult to find any customer interacting business with this level of compassion and professionalism. They treat the patients with a great attention to detail. No level of training can get this. It is a culture inside the hospital. Customer centricity at its best right from the security till the top management.So many names come to my mind to mention in different departments.I think Cytecare stands out of the crowd in terms of approach towards the ailments and the approach towards the patients and their relatives.Keep helping the patients fight the disease the right way..God bless..,5

I recommend all patients to avoid this hospital as can as possible. This hospital the worst hospital in all India ???? for many reasons:1. It is the highest cost in Bengaluru if you compare with others hospital more than 200% extral than others.2. They deal with patients as a business not as a human they care only about m1y.3. Most of patients in hospital an international patients and there are few Indian patients only because Indian patients not trust in them.4. The employees unpolit and they take care of you till you pay then they left you al1 without any assistance or help.5. Very important to know about this hospital they change their cost every day.. example if you have estimation cost from them today .. tomorrow you will get other cost ..sometimes more sometimes less.. according to your negotiation with them. They don't have systems to do prosses... they wrote the estimation cost only on Microsoft Word and after you paid their cost.. they will give you others cost more than which you agreed with them.I am full advices all to people to avoid this hospital,5

I had come to Cytecare prostate cancer treatment. The hospital staff were very helpful. The doctors are tenured and patient and have prescribed treatment for me now.I had a good experience overall!,5
Very friendly and courteous staff. Extremely efficient and well managed space. Fantastic job.,5
A uniquely designed hospital with extremely professional Dr n health care staff. We had highly enriching experience with Dr Reshmi n Dr Rathod. The front office staff are extremely professional n enjoy serving their clients. However the Admin needs to t1 up n become professional in approach n fast in attitude,5
"At Cytecare they provide a holistic care to the patient and his/her family. In fact the awesome team of Cytecare itself becomes your extended family . Be it the Doctors like Dr.Pais and Dr.Harish or the Nursing staff like Eldo, Jubin, Ambika etc, the administration like Lakshmi, Ruchira, Shaylin, the Technical staff like Prashant they all stand out when it comes to ensuring patient care and comforting the care givers.They hospital does not mislead or overcharge you and ensures the right diagnosis and treatment is given to the patient. It is a complete patient centric approach that they adopt and work as a Team in addressing the issues.May God Bless Cytecare for the great services that it is rendering. Wish and pray that they open up many more branches in Bangalire, and India.",5

"Worst hospital ever I've experienced. These ppl don't even deserve a star because of 1 lady in hr management .. A managent madam in this hospital is 1 of the rudest person I've ever seen. She doesn't even speak politely during interview but she knows how to disrespect and humiliate some1,,The management service in the hospital sucks a lot.....",5
"An awesome care, it really serves the purpose of a patient in all ways . Dr Hari Menon sir , a very expert hematology onco Expert , all the staffembers are so humble , and moreover sought a good treatment , by which my uncle is doing well . And affordable treatment . A lot of thanks to all staff and Dr Hari Menon sir .,??",5
Most unorganised hospital ever. M1y they charge for consultation and radiology is totally totally not worth for every rupee. We visited hospital for orthopaedic department it took us 3 and half hour just to finish the consultation. It has been 2 days since we took the X-ray scan and the report is still not ready. Highly disappointed. Do not recommend.,5
Hospital is clean and neat. Doctors are very co-operative and explain the things in detail.Nursing team is very Good.,5
Excellent service from Dr Kenneth and his teammates. The whole admission process was taken careThanks to all the team members who helped us through the surgery,5
"The Fraud ????I wish I could give lesser rating than 1. I have no idea how the treatment is in the hospital. Here I am going to tell how I was cheated by the HR of Cytecare Cancer Hospital - Sowmya K P. I got a call from HR, Sowmya 3 months back stating that They had an opening for International Relations designation. I went to meet her and had an interview with her, Operation Manager, Senior HR. I got a call after 2 days stating I passed the interview and she proposed that the salary is not more than my previous company as I would join a fresher. I called her next morning and said I would like to work in the hospital with the proposed salary. She heard me and hung up. Then, I had been calling for the offer letter to be released and she didnt receive my single call. In the meantime, I informed all my family members and friends the good news that I got an offer in the hospital and they all congratulated me. I again called Sowmya on 6th day asking for an update on the offer letter. She was so unprofessional that she texted on ph1 stating she couldnt proceed with my candidature since they verified my background and found not positive. Then I called her again asking for the elaboration because I have always been good student and good employee in life and no criminal records as well. She didnt receive my call. She couldnt even give an explanation on rejecting my candidature. I was devastated as I left my job relying on the job in Cytecare Hospital. You all know that how hard is to survive in Bengaluru without having a job. Now let me tell you the exact reason why Sowmya was unable to give me proper reason of the rejection. Cytecare Hospital took the interview thinking that the international flights will be coming to Bengaluru and I will be taking care of International patients; suddenly the international flights got cancelled because of having second Covid viral strain been epidemic. Cytecare couldnt even be h1st to tell me the reason of my rejection. I am sharing this story with all of you because I dont want any1 else to go through this in future.",5
"I would like to say , This is only international patient care hospital and attract VVIP patients only not for middle class people and poor .However, Too expensive charges. But Dr and consultant team are very good and take care of patients.Worst management and making m1y.",4

"I have underg1 Autologous Stem cell Transplant under Dr. Hari Menon and Dr. Vasudha. Whole BMT team was so caring and friendly that I never felt that I was in Hospital. In addition to having great knowledge and experience in the field of hematology, Dr. Hari Menon is a great Human being, very Humble and caring. He counselled me at various stages of my stay in hospital with utmost patience. Dr. Vasudha is also a great human being, very supportive and of caring nature. Hygiene of International standards and patient focused services is the hallmark of Cytecare. I was amazed to see extraordinary dedication and patience of each department of Cytecare Hospital. My Heartfelt Gratitude for all management, Patient services staff, Dr. Hari Menons Team, Nursing staff, Blood Bank staff, Housekeeping staff, Mediclaim staff, Dietician, Food staff and Psycho oncology team of Cytecare Hospital.

I'm talking about management I have ever seen like this Irresponsible Hr department,I have attended the interview for staff nurse and they made me wait for more than 5 hrs and there is no response from them even after finishing the process,, If you don't give an opportunity to the unemployed persons atleast Give respect them ??... Careless people ??????",5
"My grandmother was at Cytecare for a medical procedure and we received the most exceptional care and service from the team including the doctors, nurses and the administrative staff.

Good.,5
The best hospital for cancer... In Karnataka. Well treatment n Care,1
"I admitted my mother twice here for palliative care and it became almost our second home. Treatment with care and personal touch is what I feel is their strength besides treating cancer in a right way. Hassle free consultation of doctors, round the clock nursing care, friendly and smiling staff and most importantly doctors with different specialities consult & collaborate with each other & work as a team so that patient get a wholistic treatment experience and that to in a reasonable cost. Certain procedures for my mother were cancelled by doctor himself for which I was ready to pay. I mean I did not find m1y making attitude although I was a corporate employee with insurance protection for my mother. What I also liked that hospital is genuinely open for feedback. I personally experienced this in certain matters where I was not happy. Like they did not have inhouse MRI facility and somehow I could not get convinced on it why it should not be there being a super speciality hospital. Rest all facilities are cutting edge with 5 star comfort , cleanliness and food. Although I lost my mother but I developed very good rapport with all. Almost knows names of all the staff including housekeeping staff so will not mention anybody's name here. All the best Cytecare ????",1
"Hospital facilities are good but their charges are too high. We visited the hospital for a standard surgery for which they quoted a Bomb whereas we got the same procedure d1 with advanced process at 1 of the international hospital in Hebbal for 25% of the charges quoted by Cytecare as they projected a standard surgery as a specialized high risk surgery that to an open 1.While we do understand that they are into business but the charges have to commensurate with the procedures and prevailing market practices.PS: Rating of 3* is only based on the Visit for Consultations and nothing else as self never got treated there, though logically I could have rated it lower.",1
Recently met Dr Swati Bhatt( Palliative Care) for my mother ( Shashi) and I was very much impressed with the way she handled and spoke to us.I met few other doctors in this hospital earlier and they lack common sense in terms of how to handle patients and how to talk to them . Finally seems we have a Doctor (Dr Swati) who understands the pain of not only patients but their attendants. Thank you doctor Swati..,5
All are super,5
It is very good about everything you want from a cancer hospital. Rates are also reasonable. Staff service is also good.,5

I personally requesting to all please come and visit Cytecare Hospital once. Thank you ??",5
"Its Super costly hospital. Its bit difficult get a treatment for middleclass or poor people. Admitted my mom for 3hrs in this hospital due emergency as this hospital was near for that they charged 5000rs just for paracetamol, Dexa n tremoddol injection. I enquired for chemo n pet ct which was way costlier than other hospitals. I can see a difference of almost 8 to 10k difference compared to shankara cancer hospital.Good thing is doctors are responsible n good listeners.",1

The whole surgical team is excellent.the nursing staff and the support staff are doing good job in attending patients queries,5

1 of the best Cancer treatment hospitals in Bangalore. We went there for my mother's cancer treatment and I'm glad to say that the staff are very hospitable and caring. All the doctor's are highly skilled and professional . Attention towards cleanliness and punctuality is their top priority. Doctor Rashmi was really helpful with her diagnosis, and unlike other hospitals they are not a m1y making venture, they genuinely care about their patients. Overall I'm throughly impressed by Cytecare Cancer Hospital.
Cytecare Cancer Hospital is a blessing..2 weeks back we were not even aware that there is such a hospital...It was a sudden an unavoidable need of consulting an expert/specialist for my mother and we started to Google and found Cytecare...Since it was for mother, we didn't want to take any risk and wanted to be 100% sure...There was a dilemma since we had not heard anything about the hospital..We went through a lot of google reviews and found only positive responses.. But the heart was not convinced and we kept on thinking what to do.. Which hospital to opt for...Finally, after consulting Doctors (Dr Prasadh Narayan, Dr Rashmi) through video call, we decided that this is the place where we will get the treatment d1...So, what made us decide on Cytecare??The way our questions were answered by both Dr Prasadh and Dr Rashmi.. The initial diagnosis based on the tests reports... The motivation and comfort that there is a way.. That there are possibilities.. it gave us the clarity that yes this where we need to go!!!!Our Experience...Cytecare is a care center and that's what I would want to call this hospital... Because that's what they do!! They Care!!!Each and every1 right from the security guards, the hospital coordinators, nurses, patient assistants, house keeping, and doctors... All of them only care for patients and their apt treatment and fast recovery that too with utmost humility, patience, and a broad smile (each 1 of them) ....which is unparalleled....We are so Grateful that we got a chance to experience something which we have never experienced in whichever hospital we have visited prior to Cytecare.Had to admit my mother for a surgery and we were there for 2 and half days... Right from admission + surgery+ patient care + discharge.. Every single thing was handled by the hospital team so gracefully.. You are never lost here, as you are guided by a team who knows their job and they do it so well...The team of experts and organ specific oncologists, nurses and the entire support staff is the strength of the hospital....Thank you each and every1 Cytecare Team.. !!!You guys are ROCKSTARS!!!!!!!!!!!!

Overall Good experience. Well experienced doctors and staff
Worte experience which I have faced....
I came into Cytecare and was expecting hours and hours of waiting to get in touch with doctors. The experience was completely different from what I expected. Dr. Srinivas was extremely cooperative and carefully guided me through what had to be d1. Following this , I had to do certain procedures in the hospital. All of these procedures were handled by kind and cooperative staff. I was admitted for a surgery and was treated with utmost care and compassion. I must mention the nursing and other staff who are also every helpful. The floor coordinators ensure patient convenience. Ms Rani and Saraswati did a wonderful job of coordinating appointments with the doctors. Their follow up is par excellence.A hospital experience can be intimidating but this has been a very pleasant 1. The doctors, the facilities and the service of the staff is unparalleled.

Hi.This is poornima Singh.Treated under Dr.Prasad Narayanan, Dr Harish, Dr Poovamma for my breast cancer with good care and day care staff do their excellent jobEspecially the nursing teamAnd daycare doctors
A hospital which holistically meets and exceeds the bar in patient care. Patients and family who are already bogged down by the 'cancer' bad news need not also worry about unrealistic / unreasonable hospital charges. The hospital staff across the board are doing an excellent job. Doctors are very kind. Highly coordinated (you never get to hear that x department has not sent it so y department does not have the information hence the delay OR go check in z department we here dont handle y issues etc., etc.,). We were very happy with the care and treatment. Hospital stay was clean and hygienic, all necessary COVID related precautions and protocols in place.
Excellent treatment at Daycare and hospitality very nice.
We had an online consultation with Dr Vikram Kekatpure sir. He listened very patiently about the illness and explained the treatment plan very nicely. Very very good doctor. Highly recommended
1 of the good hospitals and great service. Keep up with the good work.

I should say that this is the best hospital available in Bengaluru for overall cancer treatment. We have visited a couple of hospitals for treatment of my mother diagnosed with low grade Nodal Marginal Z1 lymphoma, before landing at Cytecare and the worry has eased after the doctors consultation and initiation of the process of treatment. The expertise, way of interacting and examining patients, explaining the disease and course of treatment, care and planning the process of treatment of the consulting doctor Dr Hari Menon was more than excellent. Being from Tata Memorial, Mumbai, he is vastly experienced in Medical & Haemato-Oncology and his care towards his patients is surely commendable. Coming to the hospital, though it was established 4 years back, there were enormous number of success stories and my mothers treatment was also successful with complete response to the chemoimmunotheraphy treatment in just 4 cycles. There should special appreciation for the nursing staff, coordinators of the doctor, customer care and radiology for their prompt and brisk response and timely follow-up. I pray that no 1 should be infected with cancers and tumours but if 1 is, I would surely recommend Cytecare Hospitals, Bengaluru. Dont go for multiple opinions on cancer, go for a holistic 1 and Cytecare is best.
Thank you to Dr Harish Dr Ajay and Dr RaghavendraAll the services are excellent and the nurses are doing good jobSpecial thanks to daycare team.

It is the best hospital for cancer treatment..We have contacted Dr Vikram and Girish from head and neck department.The doctors explained about the disease and the treatment procedure very well..The Drs have had the experience of performing complex surgeries in head and neck region and it went well in our case as well...The post operative care given by the hospital is highly commendable..I personally thank Dr Vikram and Girish for answering all my questions and providing right guidance in treating the disease.I would highly recommend the hospital.

All the services are excellent, specially at this covid time the hospital is maintained very hygienic and control over crowd is good.The treatment here is excellent the doctors and team are doing good job
Excellent services and good care from doctors and the team
The hospital is run very efficiently. My father went through radiation during the Covid crisis, and from the start to finish, every aspect of the patient visit was taken care of efficiently - from sanitization and social distancing, on-time doctor appointments, payment installment options, and so on. Moreover they take very good care of the patient and will assist in every detail. The doctor was especially patient and explained the whole procedure many times until we understood. The hospital is never overcrowded, though there is a steady stream of patients - they seem to stagger appointments to prevent congestion. We have had a good experience so far.
I would like to thanks Dr Vikram sir Dr Girish Sir..My mom got thyroid related cancer.. Doctors explained very clearly about the situation and treatment for the same.Hospitality in the hospital is too good.Special thanks to saraswati who is helping all the times.

"Nice Ambiance and good hospitality. Very well explained in all the aspects , even from the cost counselling team.",5
"We went in with a rare diagnosis while my father was in Mumbai. We were able to do a tele-consultation with Dr. Anthony Pais who assured us that the team is able to manage it. He even asked us to come to Bangalore and meet him after a home quarantine during Covid times and assured that we could treat it after the wait.Once we were finally at the hospital, Dr. Pais and their team of surgeons, coordinators, clinicians, nursing and support staff treated our case with utmost professionalism. Each doctor spoke with us with the utmost clarity, telling us what we should expect, what the risks are and answering all our questions with patience.I would strongly recommend the hospital for its organ-based speciality departments. In a condition that drains the patient and family emotionally as much as it does physically, knowing that an extremely capable, empathetic and professional team has got your back, is all you can ask for.",5
It's a very good hospital for cancer support.,5
"Excellent service and friendliness by Doctors,Nurses and other staff..Dr poovama is kind and friendly with patient and explains the issue clearly.Dr.soumya, Dr.Bhavana and Devi has d1 a great job in chemo therapy suite.Over all I rate this hospital 5 out of 5.Keep it up.",5

"""My experience of the prestigious Cytecare Cancer Hospital is that: It is specialized in cancer treatment only and therefore 1 gets the best possible personalised treatment. The ambience is welcoming and serene, giving a very relaxed atmosphere. All the staff, from the senior most members to the support staff make 1 feel valued for example with very simple questions like """"Have you had lunch ma'am?"""" Everybody greets you with a smile. The levels of cleanliness and hygiene are very high. Our patient feels that it is amazing and we definitely made the best choice in choosing Cytecare Cancer Hospital.""",5

"My experience at Cytecare has been good, they are poised to become 1 among the best hospitals for cancer.We had consulted Dr. Hari Menon and Dr.Raghvender.Both doctors are absolute gentlemen and make a great team.Iam taking my family member home very satisfied and greatful for their treatment.A few minor glitches in the working system could be attended to though:1) The canteen service is dreadfully slow , they can take upto 2 hours to serve you anything. Their Kichidi was not cooked well and semi raw.2) The flushes in most of the toilets are not working well.They flush just partly and are very weak.3) A little better coordination among the nursing staff would be helpful. All of the staff is very good, courteous and well trained but they seem to lack a central reporting system for coordinating with each other. For example before the endoscopy there was some confusiom among the staff whether blood sample for serology drawn ir not.4)The admission and discharge is very slow if this could be fixed. The hospital would have more turn around time and generate more funds.Insurance department is very very slow.5) There is something very wrong with theelevators.Mr.Rafi, Ms.Laxmi, Ms.Lavina and Mrs.Saraswati,Security Mr.Murthy, Mr.Gopala,Mr.GaneshAll of whom have been very helpful and generous during our stay",5

In this process we have taken up counselling with Dr. Poovamma CV surgical oncologist to show my mother for a suspected breast cancer. Dr.Poovamma gave us appointment and explained everything in detail about this breast cancer problem. Right from the day 1 Dr. Poovamma has guided us and educated us in a very scientific and systemic way. Her approach towards the case was really admirable. My mother as a patient was really very confident and cheerful all the while till the surgery is over all the credit goes to Dr. Poovamma. We are very much thankful to Dr. Poovamma for a successful and perfect surgery. And also nursing staff for their dedicated service.

"First of all a very good hospital, welcoming faculty starting from the security guards to the doctors. Well and neatly maintained campus. Had booked appointment for my wife (Gynaecological Oncologist), prior to the appointment booking, had to call the hospital reception and spoke to Ms. Pavithra, she is very friendly and provided all the required information. The doctors Praveen Rathod and his assistant Dr. Rashmi, at first visit itself took time to read all the reports and understand my wife's medical history. They were able to guide us in the right direction. Also on the second visit they didn't charge the consultation fee as it was a follow-up to meet Dr. Praveen Rathod to show the reports, mean while Dr. Rashmi had discussed everything in advance with Dr. Praveen Rathod (were unable to meet him in the first visit). Dr. Praveen Rathod provided all the necessary details and also suggested some tests to check my wife's current condition, based off n which further evaluation were d1. Every1 in this hospital are very professional. Ms. Pavithra the receptionist was always helpful as I had trouble getting the medicines prescribed, whenever I messaged the issues to her, she spoke to the doctors and helped me to get the appropriate medicines. Cytecare hospital is really good with all the required facility and faculties for treatments related to cancer. I would definitely recommend this hospital to every1 ??",5

Best Hospital for Cancer Care!,4
"I had a great experience with Cytecare in Bangalore this week. I am dealing with Stage 3 prostate cancer in the United States. I was in Bangalore on business for 2 weeks and learned that the PET-CT scan my US medical team had requested for December had been denied by my insurance company. US health care is a story for another day. I knew about Cytecare from my many years of coming to Bangalore - the hospital is along the main road from the airport into the city. I contacted Cytecare last week and was immediately contacted by Lavita in their International Unit. She set up an initial consultation with a Senior Oncologist early in the following week and guided me throughout with ongoing communication. Cytecare scheduled my scan the next day at an associated Diagnostic Centre. The day after that I had another consultation at the hospital to discuss the results and a logical treatment plan. I am taking the scan images on CD, the scan report, and the oncologists advice back to the US to discuss with my team there. The Cytecare team were very professional and supportive throughout my experience and provided world class health care.",5
Thanks to Cytecare team for the excellent experience we had so far. All processes went smooth and we got a lot of encouragement. Special thanks to Dr.Harish P for his fantastic management of the Chemo process. And of course to Dr.Pais who accompanied us on the whole journey with great patience and conducted a perfect surgery along with his team.,5
"Cytecare is an excellent place to heal your cancer and the first choice that you should make to get professional help as soon as possible! We were encouraged by the homely atmosphere created by every1 from guards, receptionists, billing counter to every sisters and brother. Day ward nurses are very caring & attentive and helped me through Chemo in an optimistic manner. All doctors are very approachable and ready to explain the processes to finest detail, handholding through any crisis. Surgery was perfectly performed as well as the attentive service in ICU and ward afterwards to help me get back on my feet. Highly recommend the hospital as a special place for cancer!",5
"All, My father is undergoing treatment for Mouth cancer under able supervision of Dr. Vikram Kekatpure and Dr. Girish Shetkar for last 1 year. I could not have asked for a better place and doctors for him. I have been in US for more than 15 years and the level of care and professionalism I got from Cytecare is exemplary. I really appreciate the help provided by both doctors. The personal touch by both of them w.r.t patient and time taken by them to explain me the line of treatment is really helpful to go through this difficult time.",5

"Very good hospital.. doctors are really very good and the treatment is excellent... Nursing staff and the support staff r at their best... Good keep it up... From my point of view there is only 1 drawback of the hospital - canteen service... Food rate is overly charged.. there r many people who come there and am sure not all can really afford the charges of the food and the worst part is no other food service is near to the hospital and poor people r forced to spend too much of m1y.. if some subsidy is given on food, am 100% sure no other hospital can beat Cytecare... I have seen many poor people come to this hospital for treatment, if some subsidy is given to them on food it will be of great help..",5

Good response from staff andDoctor'sWe are thankful to Dr.Poovamma C.UFor her patience to explain in details of surgery and how to take Care afterwardsThank you.??,5
Very good service and good coordination with patients treatment is good,5
"Individual doctors are good but they lag a team of surgoen if the procedure is long. e.g. if a part is removed and reconstructed , everything is expected from a single doctor .I never met a plastic surgeon who would have been performing the flap work once onco surgeon has removed the infected part.Also, the hospital seems pretty m1y minded. In a short span of time the consultancy charge has increased significantly. They even charge you if you bring pet scan from outside to upload into system. As if they won't store if pet scan was d1 in hospital itself.The navigators are helpful but psychological doctors do time pass.they never bother to call patient.you just go n see them in cabin .Finally regarding treatment it felt like each department is running on brilliance of 1 single doctor but a disease like cancer needs a good team in each department whether it is surgical, medical onco or radio therapy.I would suggest to visit cancer hospital who has some experience in dealing with disease and has a established team than 1 highly paid doctor in each department and others just learning from him without much contribution.",5

"""Checking reviews on the net and information from friends and doctors made me select Cytecare Hospital for treatment of my sister for breast cancer. We were well received at reception though without prior appointment. Dr Poovamma attended our case. She patiently reviewed our reports and explained in detail every bit of information regarding the problem, surgery and post surgery issues. Dr Poovamma is a dedicated doctor who is willing to spend extra time to find and diagnose the origin of the cancer cells during investigation even if calls for at the end of her duty time. We are really touched by her concern.All the staff at hospital receive very nicely whether billing, nursing, PA staff attached to the doctor and security.I will certainly recommend my friends for Cytecare Hospital.My reviews are after """"SEEING IS BELIEVING"""".Capt PDReddyNehru NagarYelahanka""",5

Keep it up Cytecare!,5
"Before coming to special features of the hospital, let me say what the hospitals in (banglore ) and(coimbatore) do.1) There you'll need to wait for the doctor after getting the token, they don't care about patients physical state.2) The next part explains why the patient gets frustrated in those hospital it's because of the doctor's harsh response and as the doctor will not be in the mindset to hear what the patient says.3) And the major worst part is that the doctor will not give any kind of anesthesia to a patient who suffers from a horrible hand pain which is a side effect from a treatment when they suggest for MRI.4) They won't care it's ayudha pooja or other festival, they'll just ask the patient to get admit for a treatment and they'll be cleaning the bed while giving CHEMO to a patient without any second thought.And now i'll say about CYTECARE and you'll now why it's most satisfying to get the treatment there!1)They are best at their hospitality, the place will be so neat and i thank the management to care like that.2) Finally i was able to see a doctor who treats the patient like a human, cause when i was taking 1 of my family member there , the person was suffering heavy hand pain and the first thing what they did was so amazing, they didn't ask us to get the token and made us stand in line, they took her to ICU for immediate treatment which was totally missing in HIGH-CLASS hospitals now-a-days, so they care the patients for real.3} There starting from the compounder and nurse and supporting staffs till the doctor every1 was being so nice and they made themselves available to the patient when needed most.4) and the final thing the food it was good, bit costly but it's the kind of atmosphere where the patient can feel like they can be cured.And main reason behind such lengthy post, My family people got satisfied after 7 long years running behind big hospitals, which says the perception of big hospital is good turns to be a lieIn this modern ERA i felt like the doctors does not work with humanity, but it was not true in CYTECARE's care!a Special Thanks to CYTECARE staffs and management!... thank you people",5
"few days ago 1 of my doctor suggest me for pet scan i was nervous but 1 of my frnd gave me numbr of Mr .Aadil .... the way he explained and they way he talk was absoultly quite amazing it was worth to spend around 25 minutes with him, amazing ,i guess the precious gem the hospital had found",5
"A hospital with utmost care of the patient with dedicated staff, dutiful attenders under the supervision of professional staff. Prompt delivery of food and punctual attention of the duty nurses with a smile in their face itself is a relief of the pain. MRM d1 by Dr Anthony Pais and the post care provided by his fellow dedicated doctors is really appreciatable. As this hospital located in outer city it is very good for the 1 suffers from Ca to be treated in a non poluted atmosphere.",5

"Big Thumbs up to this hospital....!!!Being in medical field, I can rate this the best hospital I've ever visited...From beautiful interior to detailed attention given to each patient is outstanding...Initially was reluctant to visit this hospital as it was very far from my residence, it was just like a second opinion and experience was amazing, that I decided to continue all future treatment in this hospital...Dr Harish P, was excellent in patient approach & he counseled me regarding the condition, possible complication, treatment outcome etc etc... He spent close to an hour with the patient... He spoke very well and it built good confidence with the patient about the hospital... Admission process was smooth, chemotherapy went very well..Dr Raghavendra & team of doctors was excellent in treating my father to relieve him off excruciating pain. He was very good in analyzing the best treatment to relieve pain and was successful too. I would like to thank him and all his junior doctors...Patient Care was outstanding from Nursing side, they were very courteous and helpful.Lohith Brother was good.Once again I thank Cytecare hospital for the wonderful experience.....!!!!!- Dr Sudarshan",4

The entire treatment was systematically mapped out and followed meticulously. Hospital records are maintained and tracked very well. Also the Hospital is spic and span . Its a really nice environment to be in, as my wife's treatment used to be for 5 days for each Chemotherapy, we never felt like we were going into a hospital, it was more like a resort ! The nursing staff is always welcoming and woud deliver good care with smiling faces , they come at all odd hours of the night to assist if required, without any complaints.

"Hi, being a survivor for the past 2 years, after being treated at Shankara with Chemotherapy, I had opted out of radical removal of the bladder and was surviving on alternate therapy without any mishaps. In April growth was detected and a cystectomy was planned. Here onwards my turmoil started . In a nearby recognised hospital in Basavanagudi. I had to get admitted to another hospital for getting cured of the blood clotting and blood letting in the urine.as I was sent home due to insurance package terms. The hospital did not have a scheme to get me admitted on cash to ensure full cure.This point of time I was referred by a well meaning friend to Cytecare Hospital. I met the CEO, who understanding the deep turmoil and anguish i was suffering due to bad treatment elsewhere, arranged for tour of the hospital, and meeting with surgeons to ease my mind. I took an appointment and met the Medical oncologist who suggested a PET Scan.During the break of the Scan the doctor came down and called my sons to his chambers and advised that he had seen the scan and that I had no alternative than to go for radical removal of the bladder as the cancer was restricted to it only. Immuno therapy not being so developed he advised against it. THIS KIND OF TRACKING AND CONCERN IS SOMETHING SUPERB - NEVER FOUND IN ANY BIG HOSPITAL.When I went the next day and met him, he called for a customer care executive and she lead me to the Uro Oncologist/ surgeon. After discussing the matter with him and fixing the date, she lead me to the Anaesthesist, then to a Gastro Surgeon who stepped out of OT just to talk to me and clear all doubts. Next she took me to the gastroentologists team who checked various details in preparation of the surgery. then to the Dietician who guided on the pre operation diet and finally to the Insurance desk.Never have I nor any of my huge group of friends ever seen or heard of such patient centric service.Monday 27th May was the date of the operation and I got admitted at 7.00 am. Soon enough the procedures started with each team collecting data etc and finally by 11.00 am they were ready. 1.30pm or so was taken into the OT. The surgery got completed by around 10.00 Pm.In the Post operation ICU, the treatment was surely tender and very attentive care. Any movement was noticed and a nurse was by my side. It was really heavenly. As progress was slow but sure due to my age, I stayed till Friday in the ICU. Once I shifted to the ward, I found the patient centric care stepped up to yet another level, I was blessed. Though a bell was available for us to ring in need there are no need to ring. In clockwork precision Nurses, Patient Care Staff, walked in, did their duty and stepped out.I stayed in the ward for a week and as Doctors promised they would neither rush to send me home and nor send me home without being fully cured, I got discharged yesterday. Feeling fit enough to sit in front of the computer I feel it my duty to give my feed back and rating.My treatment and stay at this Cytecare Hospital has been 1 of the Best times i ever enjoyed a hospital stay.The Owners, the Management team, the Customer Care Manager and Executives, the Nursing staff and the Patient care staff ARE ALL VERY DEVOTED AND WORK ONLY TO ENSURE THE CURE TO THE PATIENT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE METHODS.The Hospital does not offer package plans but an estimate for the number of days required etc and in case of any extension they give the per day extension cost upfront. This is something very superb and very comforting to patients and their families.CARETAKERS OF PATIENTS HERE SLEEP PEACEFULLY AT NIGHT BECAUSE THE CYTECARE NURSING AND PATIENT CARE STAFF ARE EVER PRESENT TO MEET ALL REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATIENTS. WITHOUT BEING CALLED. SUPERVISION IS OF SUCH EXEMPLARY LEVEL.What more does anybody want for a complete cure!Kudos to Cytecare team and God Bless all !!!",5
Not a good hospital. This hospital is just for m1y. Not authentic in their reports. Very bad experience.,4

"I think we can all agree on what makes the Hospital great:1. Impeccable doctor's treatment2. Amiable care/aid by Nurses3. Orderly administered staff with well maintained roomsWell, Cytecare certainly outranks on all these. Doctors are highly skilled such as Dr. Anand & Dr. Vasudha who are specialist in Pediatric Oncology and they promote the culture of doing research which is a good factor on the verge of improvement. Nurses are friendly and they always have a smile. Facility staffs for eg: House Keeping, security are well behaved with outright job conscience.My kid is being treated here and they are generous/hospitable towards his care. My notion towards cancer is daunting but hospital's perspective is contrary and they dealt with standard protocol in treatment; educating parents towards care. He is almost cure and I am grateful for what you have d1.Again, I thank you with all my heart to all of you! :)",5

I Never found him as�a Sugar-coated doctor or thinking of making m1y... In fact when all other doctors won't look into my case carefully cause 'not-a-regular-patient' , Menon Sir always would give h1st opinion and suggest whatever is the right optimal way for the patient. His main focus is not to trouble patient more and give healthy life in whatever ways needed.I am glad to have CyteCare help for my Dad so far.

And Thank you Cytecare.We came here by expecting the good but now we are getting the best.,5

"I underwent my Chemotherapy in this hospital and had a wonderful experience. My doctor, Dr. Prasad Narayanan - Sr. Consultant - Medical Oncologist, was very helpful and guided me through the entire treatment. He was always available for any questions or concerns we had. The highlight of this hospital is the wonderful team of Nurses and admin staff. The nurses in the procedure room are very thorough with how they do the dressing and clean up. I would like to specially mention the following people who always looked after me with a smile - Leena, Neena, Karunya, Leya, Ensteen and Linju. Before the chemo started, I was adviced to get the PICC line d1, which was administered by Eldho and Vineesh. They are skilled in this procedure and made all my apprehension and worries about the PICC line go away. The Chemo suite staff are wonderful and very attentive to the needs of every individual. I would like to specially mention the following staff members who made my stay a pleasant 1 - Dr. Usha, Sangeetha S, Prashanth, Divya and Jubin. The hospital is also the only center that I am aware of, which is specializing in post surgery oedema treatment, lead by Dr. Raghavendra and his team of Dr. Amelia and Lohith. They guided me on how to take care of my hand post surgery and treatment. The hospital also provides great moral support to patients in the form of Oncopsychologist, Dr. Revathi Menon. She was very keen on my mental well being through the procedure. Finally the admin staff is well managed by Shylin and Neethi. Overall a wonderful experience and great support during my battle with cancer",5

"By far the Best care hospital. Through out the cycle of diagnosis, surgery, chemo, radiation, consultation etc. we received gentle and highly professional attention. Very courteous staff at all levels make us feel at home. Comforts the patient as well as the attending family members.The 'Navigators' (who are ex-patients/fighters) taking rounds everyday providing moral support to patients on a personal non-medical level are an amazing team in boosting the will-power and fighting spirit of the patient. They provide answers to questions which a patient may probably feel delicate to ask a doctor. They are like Family.The periodic get-together seminars and music/quiz programs are very informative and entertaining.Keep up the good work. God bless.",5

I tried to show surgeon doctor the MRI report hat he asked for but Jerin jumped to me and refused to see doctor unless i pay 1000 INR. I just paid 2 days ago but he totally he refused not to see doctor even for a second or clarification without paying . Peopel pay 700 but he instruct reception to pay me 1000.I also asked him to.let me see the oncologist doctor just to let doctor to clarify a confusion on his report which i just paied for a consultant 2 days ago , But Mr.jerin again refused saying you can't even see or spoke to any doctor without paing 1000 INR , i said to him please just 1 minute to see doctor he wrote on the report things need more clarification and why paying me since i paid 2 days . I only need 1 minutes , and if doctor him self asked to pay i will pay .He said impossible to even see him without paing (saying with provocative way , made the patient very angery and he don't care about anythinh patient told i will leave this hospital).Reception team are very helpful and tried to tell Mr.Jering he just want to show a report he already paid for consult, but he got anger on her saying nooo pay him. Reception girl eyes saying i need to help you but i cant because of him. What i feel that they also heat his way of dealing with pateints.In general Doctors are good .But Mr.Jering is a very bad person , since you enter the interance he jump to you as lion jump to prey , he follow you everywhere you go like a body guard with bad behavoir with you . All his consentration is on m1y and just telling secertary big amounts of payment . What Jerin say they can not say no . They try to help but he prevent them.I have medical office and will never send any patient while Mr.Jerin there , also spoked to my friend about his bad behivoiur .His face and way of treatment make patient anger and need to leave hospital.I have dealed with many hospitals , i have never seen anybody deals like Mr.Jerin.it is not just a m1y issue it way of dealing of tjis guy also .I told him i visited columbia asia and Ster hospital and no 1 payid me second time when showing a report , he said ok go there.If i wrote 100 page i cant describe this bad guy.Also prices are high in this hospital they asked for 24000 INR for pelvic MRI , i did it outside with 9000 inr ( Maybe it is Mr.jerin price )Not recomend hospital for any international patients",5
"My mother was admitted to Cytecare as a last resort after a delay of 18 months from date of detection, where in interimly alternative medicines was tried which only aggravated the growth of cancer.We realised our mistake the day we met Dr.Prasad and right away got her admitted. By God's grace she is responding well and halfway through the treatment.Touchwood.Now she is undergoing the next cycle of treatment and hope she responds well. Hence am writing this review with an amount of hesitation since we have become superstitious after all the previous treatments failed. Hope she fully recovers and the hospital continues it's good work.To our surprise, the entire hospital was found to be highly professional in their approach. Very courteous, kind and understanding to the needs of patients and their caretakers too. They know their job very well.Would like to thank Dr. Prasad, Dr.Raghavendra, Dr.Harish, Dr.Ajay Rao, Dr.Vijetha, pyscho-onco team and all their team members and other support staff from reception, nurses, housekeeping and whoever not menti1d herein, who always had a smile on their face and kind words to say.",5

"My Father is alive only because of Allah and Efforts of Cytecare hospital staff. Here is my detailed review about my 10 days stay at cytecare hospital.We shifted my father to Cytecare hospital with my friend reference. Because treatment of earlier hospital M* ******h was not satisfactory there was no improvement after spending 900000 INR.At Cytecare our case discussed in Board Room Meeting with efficient Doctors like Dr. Prasad, Dr. Kenneth and Dr. Dinesh-(Super Star of Cytecare of hospital). We felt very happy after consulting with them and my father Gastrectomy was planned on next week.Unfortunately my father suffered severe hematemesis (Blood Vomit-tings), we rushed our father to hospital in early morning hours of 5 AM to hospital, his BP was fallen to 44/67 and but he was struggling to life and death.I was very happy and shocked to see all the relevant doctors arrived to hospital on SUNDAY within 1 hour time Dr. Dinesh (Super Star), Dr. Kenneth, Dr. Vinod and other Doctors, they planned for immediate surgery which was high risk L13. All the doctors explained me the risk of surgery with complete protocols of SAVING MY FATHER. I have been visiting multi specialty hospitals from last 10 years in India and abroad, never got to see doctors coming in on SUNDAY and saving lifes.My Father condition was (Diabetic, BP was 44/67, Anemic HB 6.7 and symptoms of TB as well). Grace Allah and Doctors efforts Surgery was successful, During and after time surgery Doctors always said that My Father is recovering and responding very well (Best Humility part is: They never and said that we are doing our best). In ICU also it was state-of-the-art care was given by Nurses, Orthopedic Dr. and Head Nurse. They deserve big reward.Special Thanks to Dr. Kenneth and His team.Thanks ton to Dr. Dinesh - He is best motivator to my father and myself I call him Super Star of Cytecare Hospital.I would love to write about supporting staff:Billing Department: Rekha and her team (Yashas, Lakshmi, Komal Singh and 2 people sits in ICU ward in night shift)They were always kind and helped us out understanding How much was current detail bill, expected bill and current bills. We have been informed by them very transparently and without any ambiguity.Nursing Staff: Nursing staff were very agile, very caring and always gave my dad best of confidence to recover faster. They took of my father as small baby.Housekeeping: Especially Mr. Santhosh charismatic speaker he always gave me new dimensions to think on trust and care A big thank you to Mr. Santhosh Sir (A guy with spectacles). His staff was also well responded to the call of duty without any hesitation, they were very contained and committed to work. Never showed us influence gifting something to them, it is never the case in other hospitals. Thank you Santhosh for keeping me motivated in my difficult time of life.Security: Mr. Srinivas is super man of cytecare hospital though I just had 5 minutes interaction in elevator. His security personnel was so down to earth they always wished us 2 hands folded Namasthe which reliver of stress. Security at cytecare is very punctual, kind and h1st in showing us directions of wards, helping us in understanding hospital exit, parking and other procedures. Every1 was respected us with their utmost behavior and attitude.These are my heartfelt reviews to CYTECARE hospital, In every family father is head of the family: Thanks a ton for making our family alive once again.",5
Took my mother in law for cancer treatment and we are extremely pleased with the services and support offered.The doctors are very well qualified and courteous and took us through the procedures in detail.The staff are also very well behaved and provide top notch customer service.The hospital is well maintained and very clean.We recommend the hospital to others for the above reasons.Keep it up Cytecare and the whole team associated with it!,5
"My 79 year old father was admitted at Cytecare after we carefully considered all options and othercancer centers for treatment care. We have been wowed by the professional and personable staff who care for my dad so well with so much love, energy and passion for cancer patient care.I personally have spent a lot of time in the USA consulting with the worlds best cancer treatment centers like Mayo Clinic and I find the Cytecare docs especially Dr Raghavendra and his team, equally knowledgeable, care standards top class and they are very responsive to both the patients needs as well as my familys wishes and concerns.My mother was the primary care giver staying with my dad 24/7 and she had forgotten her own medications, the staff was so kind to go get her medicine from a pharmacy simply because she could not leave the bed side of my father.In summary, we have been very satisfied with the treatment and service, if this helps another family and patient make up their mind on getting treatment at this hospital, I highly recommend Cytecare.",5
"Here to say a few positive things I noticited in the hospitalIt has a beautiful atmosphere andStaff from the security levell are very polite and humble. Thanks to Mr Srnivas for the excellent security serviceRooms and corridors are very hyginic.My husband was reffered by Dr Anthony Pais . Dr Prasad Narayanan is very professional and inspires confidence . Dr Harish, Dr Feba, Dr Senthamarai are polite and humbleWith reference to the Navigator Mili Baruah who is very cheerful and bubbly brings a breath of fresh air into cytecare.Special thanks to billing deprtment names I would like to mention Prema, Madhu and Varsha and last but not the least Ms Rekha who comes across as a very able administrator .We would like to thank all of you for making our stay very confortable",5
"""My mom was undergoing treatment for multiple growths without much results at the """"so called renowned Cancer hospital"""" at Bangalore ie HCG. There wasn't much of help and they had given us 3 months time after forcing multiple surgeries upon us. We had finished the 1st surgery (removal of breast tumour) and were proceeding to the next (Colo rectal surgery). Needless to say she was suffering every day and we were running pillar to post within HCG.. Who weren't responsive to the critical situationI heard of Cytecare and was totally astounded by the immediate response of the medical team that assured me that she doesn't have to undergo surgery and they have advanced alternative treatments to help her handle the growth that was there in liver and colorectal area",with traces in lungsDr Prasad Narayanan and his wonderful team aided with Palliative department started immediate treatment and 3 months into it

He's an excellent oncologist: knowledgeable- makes the right call on treatment regimen and patient- takes the time to listen and explain.Hospital facilities are good too. All types of scanning and imaging available under 1 roof. Clean environment and friendly staff.Price for services that I have availed so far, have been reasonable, i e. mostly at par with Tata Memorial Hospital, which is a government run establishment.",4
"I saw many hospital in this 6 months CYTECARE is the best hospital as per my experience its for more beter than HCG CANCER CENTER... CYTECARE having very good location, building, Dr's, more over its very less price they are charging...Mind blowing treatment...",5
"Professional staff, taking care of patients and the care takers in best possible way. All the staff members, right from Reception, Lab technicians, Insurance desk, doctors & nurses, work as a team and effectively co-ordinate. Doctors are very friendly and patiently listen to all concerns & problems. Patients get confidence in the medicine prescribed by the doctors.",5
Very Good Ambience and Feel like home very good care taking from all the staffs and doctors of the hospital.,5

A referral was made to Cytecare hospital. Since arriving here. They haven't disappointed. Courteous staffs, clean eenvironment, Doctors who are very certain of their activities and machinery to support them too. During the admission, the wards are very clean, comfortable and delicious food served on time and right temperature. You can never go wrong with Cytecare Cancer Hospital, Bangalore.",5
"I want to do health checkup and screening, i got to know this hospital from google and i g1 thru the google review and feedback. Based on the review comments, i decided to go this hospital. This hospital is little far from my location. But it is best hospital I have ever seen. All the staff is very professional, helpful and courteous. Especially day care person Ms. Soumee, her cooperation and assistance help me lot for entire screening section from morning to evening. I want to thank, her cooperation and coordination. I recommend whoever wants to go, not to hesitate just step forward.",5
"Dr. Prasad Narayanan is a wonderful Doctor. The admin staff is great, Akash and the team. The Nurses in the procedure room and Chemo suite are experienced and take good care of the patients. It has been a great experience so far at Cyte Care. The hospital could improve on the discharge process as it takes time inspite of the efforts of the admin staff.",5
Very very bad existencee.... Very unprofessional... Doctors don't care about people waiting... They love chit chatting with there people and have no professionalism... They take appointments but they don't care whose waiting.. Very good lying... They say doctors are in rounds but fixture are not even in the hospital because they are stuck in traffic.. Totally insane right .. you'll step ito with same feeling..,5
"What a pathetic hospital , they can't manage it .only they know hang around tea shop.dont go for cancer screening.they dont care.",5
Pathetically managed.. We came here at 11am for woman cancer screening but it was wrong decision. They dont have dedicated staff to handle Health check up. All staff leave there place and enjoy tea cofee at counter. You will see patients suffer they enjoy the AC. Lots of staff but no solutions. They hang around.they did not complete the procedure said doctors are busy. Dont go there. Apollo and Manipal are better place. This pelole only look for party whom they can change after that they dont care.,5

"I had a mixed experience in this hospital..It has very excellent medical team,the Doctors,nurses,patient care..note I had some sessions on chemo,surgery and radiotherapy..never was I disappointed by any team..the Navigators keep you informed and the psycho oncologist keeps your nerves calmMy greatest disappointment which I h1stly wouldn't hide was to do with the billing and the team that handles international patients..this team gives you a lot of stress when it comes to payment issues..note you leave your country ready to meet your hospital bills..won't mention much of my odeal with them but management should game up on this..They will hike the bills...Bill you for services not given....They will want you to deposit as much dollars as you can and it's hustle getting your balance back..They will want to tag you to a certain blocker much as you were just a walk in or a referal to a particular doctor..too much stress..customer care not good.Well because of the good doctors and nursing team I will always come for my reviews but will be extra careful with the customer care and the billing staff..I Am sorry but this had to come out",5
"Excellent hospital. The doctors here are very much on top of their subject which you can sense with their confidence in the dealings . Here i would make a very special mention of my surgeon Dr Kenneth Dcruz whom i cannot thank enough for treating me with his exemplary standards .They also try their best to keep the patient well informed of the issue and various treatment options. The hospital is very neat clean and hygenic work a very decent canteen as well. The private ward is very comfortable with adequate luxury. you get the feeling that a lot of thought has been put to get the design of the hospital very thorough. Last but never the least the nurses, various other care taking staff , various admin all were not only adept at work but really happy to help which was so evident in their body language , and makes the stay feel like being at home. All in all I would say cytecare is a benchmark of a hospital. It's primarily a cancer treatment hospital but can do other surgical procedures as well which can be made known . thanks for your service and keep up the good work",5
The hospital is best for cancer. I also cure here. There Doctor and stuff very well.,5
"I went there with a lot of apprehension. You know when you enter a Cancer hospital as patient it is kind of scarry. But right from the watchman at the gate, the receptionist and all who followed had such beautiful smiles that I felt at ease. I was lucky too that there was nothing wrong with me. Dr. Pius was so attentive and so was Dr Mukta. Gems all of them. Thanks so much.",5
5 star will be too less for the care and extraordinary attitude of the doctor. (Dr.Prasad),5
very very good,5
The staff have been very helpful n very polite in every way. Am very greatful for the good services offered in Cytecare hospital. Starting from from office extended to the doctors protocal. Am very happy. Hv no words to express but to say may The Good God may always bless you all.,5
"Professional and efficient staff, functioning with a smile (20/10/18).Thoughtful enough to hand me a bottle of water. I observed that the doctors were very good natured (I am in NO position to judge their expertise). CONSISTENCY is the key, which every other Venture loses after promotion period. WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN STAYING CONSISTENT.",5
"The navigation department helps you right from the admission to meeting specialized doctor. The day care people are doing a great job. You will find a very good support from customer care service. The ambience, facilities and people are very nice.",5

"Cancer never gives a warning before invading the patients body and their lives. When my mother was diagnosed with Cancer in Nov 2016 she was already on a high stage of her cancer. I had to start her treatment immediately so I hardly had a lot of time to start searching for doctors or hospital. After 2 cycles of chemo when the situation was a bit under control and I started my research of finding the right doctor, better hospital for her further treatment. I was introduced to Cytecare by a friend in Dec 2016.From my very first interaction with their Senior Consultant: Medical Oncologist Dr. Prasad Narayan (from treatment & diagnosis POV) & their Hospital Administration Head Ms. Rehka Shivakumar (from hospitalisation POV) I got the confidence that there are hospitals and doctors in India that think of patients care first & help patients family to take informed decisions. At Cytecare I felt the approach towards treating the patient is holistic and comprehensive. They not only maintain higher treatment standards and follows protocols but also maintain a very high level of integrity.Each time, my mother had to to admited in ward or in day care I felt that her doctors and nursing/support teams approach toward her gave her a lot more confidence to fight back and feel good from within. I strongly believe a lively, hygienic & comfortable environment helps patients a lot emotionally to fight back their illness, especially something like Cancer that has already created a huge amount to anxiety within the patient and the family. Cytecare provides just the right environment.And at times I have felt they have g1 beyond expectation ??  thank you so much!From my experience since last 2 years I can say 1 thing for sure that each doctor (especially Dr. Prasad Narayan & Dr. Roopesh N), Patient counseling team (especially Meera Mam & Mili), Supporting medical team (Psycho Onco - Michelle, Dietitian - Mou), Nursing team, Ward Care teams, Billing & other Admin teams (Rekha & her team - Sunil, Vasanth, Shreerama & others), Radiation team (Dr. Ajay Rao & Dr. Vijetha Jayakumar), every1 been very supportive. Each and every member I ever had interaction with felt that they have the right sensibility and empathy towards the patient and their family.I am grateful how they have been taking care of my mother in the last 2 years.",5
"Treatment n services are amazing , Doctors Caretakers n admin have helped a lot in every process.Thanks a lot to the entire team .",5
"Very happy with everything,Doctors,staffs cleanliness name it .Its just awesome, God bless",5
"Cytecare is not a hospital,It is home away from home so well managed. All staff members are self motivated at all levels attending to the patients round the clock (security housekeeping,customcare,nursing staff,F&B)The navigators-Ms Milli ,Ms Asha,Mrs Meera were awesome they made the situation so easy to accept by their continues interaction with us.Not forgetting the nutritionist Dr Esther who adviced and constantly followed up with our diety requirement .Special mention of the young Dr Povamma who is outstanding,charming and made things so simple for the family to accept and handle the situation .Wish all the members of cytecare all the best and a big thankq to all for attending my relative who was undergoing the treatment in this hospital .",5
I'm taking treatment for ALL from Dr.Hari Menon.He's 1 of the best doctors in oncology.Excellent treatment and facilities.Nursing staff are very compassionate and supportive. All the staff are very friendly with lot of positivity.Charges are less compared to other cancer speciality hospitals.Highly recommended for cancer treatment,5
It was a good experince and the all stuf nice.I would like to thank Dr. Vikram as he is 1 of the best doctor and a respectful person.And also I would not forget Komal who helped us a lot.,5

"""Dear Team CyteCare,I've fortunately been under the personalised care of Dr Vikram Kekarpure since 2014 & once he shifted to CyteCare I too happily followed ..and so have the many references I've given over the years .As an outpatient my requests for appointments thru Ms Rekha Shivakumar have always been accommodated & Sunita personally takes care of my routine tests.Not once have these routine appoint ments been delayed !!Last week, I was an in patient for a minor surgery & Dr Girish & Dr Kekarpure were most caring & endearing .My Family felt most reassured while interacting with Dr Kekarpure .The Insurance Team of Varsha & Manujith & the Nursing Team with Sri Lakskmi , Deepu & Jobish went the """" extra mile """".I'm a Hotelier & such sustained levels of service delivery are an exception & for a Hospital to constantly meet & exceed the expectations as is d1 at CyteCare is truly a huge achievement & a tribute to the Team.My Compliments to Team CyteCare)""",5

As I had g1 to Dr. Kenneth DCruz for a hernia check-up he had asked me to do a few teats and a CT scan, which shown a lump in the breast.I was referred to Dr. Anthony Pais of Cytecare Cancer hospital by Dr. Kenneth. If not for Dr. Kenneth DCruz I would have not known that I have breast cancer and I am so grateful and thankful to him. I also visited him at his clinic many times but he did not take his consultations fee. May God bless him & his family for all the good work he is doing.When I visited Cytecare Cancer hospital and met Dr. Anthony Pais and after a couple of tests he confirmed breast cancer and advised me for a surgery. Dr. Anthony Pais along with his team of doctors made me feel very safe and comfortable in the operation theatre and the ward.After 1 month of the surgery I started chemo as advised by Dr. Prasad Narayanan. During my chemo treatment which lasted for 12 weeks. Dr. Prasad Narayanan made me feel very comfortable and would visit me every time the chemo treatment was going on. I still go to him for checkups and I must thank Dr. Prasad Narayanan and the doctors & Staff of the day-care centre.I would like to thank Dr. Anthony Pais, Dr. Prasad Narayanan, Dr. Kenneth DCruz and all the doctors & staff of Cytecare cancer hospital. May God bless each 1, my prayers will always be for them.I advise any1 with any sign cancer to please go to Cytecare Cancer hospital and I assure you of the best treatment & love.Elaine Lewis",4
The place is better then other hospitals and the doctor's give time to their patients making them feel comfortable and they give treatment keeping the patience comfort in mind.,5
"Having diagnosed with Breast cancer and looking for a place of treatment, I chanced upon Cytecare and took the chance. I am so glad I did. I met Dr. Anthony Pais and I knew I had come to the right place.Dr. Prasad Narayanan and Dr. Anthony Pais were the best team I could ask for to help me make it through. They re-defined normal for me and broke all the mental shackles I could have had regarding cancer. 1 word  brilliant I was working through the entire treatment and living a normal life  thanks to them treating me so normal and never allowing me to feel bad for myself or feel any different.The day care staff are awesome individuals who resonate so much positive energy that chemotherapy felt like a walk in the park. Yes I am making it sound simple but truly, they made it so simple for me. Smiling faces I would meet and smile through the day. For my surgery, I was in hospital for 2 weeks and the attention and care I got was very good. Treatment is their top priority but there is absolutely no compromise on the mental well -being of the patient. During this phase, a big focus is diet and nutrition  I havent seen any hospital emphasizing on this so much. Esther is like a genie who was constantly moderating my nutrition need and ensuring I was being fed happy food while keeping my treatment in mind. I found many happy souls who not only helped in me this journey but have become friends  Michelle and Mili are 2 of them. I have to mention the help staff who do their duty with so much love and dedication. Special mention to Suresh Ramu- CEO who is so hands on and probably that is why this hospital is so different from any other healthcare institution.Today I have finished my treatment and I have the entire staff to thank  from those at the reception to the doctors, nurse and help staff. Every1 in this hospital is such a giving person that they make you feel comforted and happy through this journey",5
"Visited Cytecare hospital,bangalore for my mother in law's treatment. Glad to have visited as I was able to understand the illness better. Kudos !!! to the front office team who coordinated doctor's appointment and all billing details would like to specially appreciate Akash Ravindran for all the support for coordinating with the lab for us to have received reports.",5
Should give zero review to this hospital. only m1y making . We just went for a second opinion from Dr Kenneth Dcruz. Never met such a doctor who just took 2 seconds to read the report and said not possible. We requested him to see the CT scan CD (which he can see from his monitor) but he referred 1 more doctor Radiologist and 1 more for general physician. each doctor have their own fees . We came with our problem and that doctor is just in making m1y. Never visit this hospital they just suck m1y as blood and make people to die. I dont know how they are getting this waste reviews. I went by reviews please dont make such mistake. Seeing the sad face of Dr Kenneth Dcruz never feel like patients can have any suggestion to live further happily.,5
"Cytecare Hospital is a very good hospital for.cancer, also it has a very helpful staff.I'd like to say thank you",5
Cytecare hospital is 1 of the best hospital in India I came and found the Doctorsand all staffs are so commited to their service,5
Everything is good from down to up.Doctors and Management very supportive.,5
Amazing. Simply the best. It's a 5 star from me. I love Cytecare.,5

"Hi, this is Kokila. Whoever is reading this review might be because you or some1 whom you love/care is diagnosed with Cancer. Well, you are in the right place.You must be going through lot of confusion on deciding where to get the treatment d1, which doctor to approach, will I get right treatment and so on. Since, I have g1 through this confusion, during my initial days of my diagnosis, I am writing below review, which might help you to get some answers to your questions.As most of you know already, for any cancer treatment, the common protocol followed by most hospitals, is chemo, surgery and radiation. But, it is important to choose right medication with appropriate dosage and that can be d1 only by proper analysis of disease by best team doctors, including Medical Oncologist, Surgeons, Pain management, Radiologist and rest of doctors.In my case, I was lucky to get in contact with Dr. Prasad Narayan, who did thorough analysis of my situation and exploring best chemo medication available in the market, appropriate for my case. As my situation was very complicated, he evaluated multiple opinions from various senior doctors on our behalf, to give best solution. His knowledge, patience and caring nature has helped get my disease, in control. Thanks to him and I would say, he is best Medical oncologist in Bangalore.Talking about cancer treatment, it is not only about medication targeting the tumor, but it is side effects of medications and pain we have to deal with the tumor. I was going through great deal of pain and approached multiple doctors in city, but no 1 could get me the relief, from my pain. At last, I got reference to Dr. Ragavendra and his experience in pain management proved to be best in my case. He treated my case with such an intense of care with right medication, dosage and procedures to attack the root cause of my pain. He works closely with individuals to patiently listen to the problem and provides the best pain management solutions. It is rare to find such a passionate, h1st and patient centric professional.I would also appreciate the support provided by Radiologists Dr. Muktha and Dr. Nagraj for their thorough analysis of the disease through appropriate scan and reports. They both have immense knowledge in field and are guiding the Surgeons and Oncologists to provide best care to patients.Last but not the least; I want to thank the nursing staff, who played critical role in giving comfort and care during the chemotherapy cycles. With all the pain, I was going through, their smile and care, was very comforting.Past 1 and half year, which I spent in fighting this horrifying disease, Cytecare team of doctors, nursing and other staff, stood by my side and helped me get out of this tough phase of my life. I am very grateful for their support and care.Thank you Cytecare team. Please continue to provide best care, support and cure to many more patients.",5
Highly recommended ..efficient doctors and staff,5
Cytecare has been a saviour of my condition since 2018 when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer.Dr. Poovamma has not just been a surgeon treating my condition but always a pillar of support guiding me through this long journey of my recovery. Thank you to all the support staff at Cytecare who have always made me feel at home during this journey. Every staff irrespective of their different job profile was always there to attend to any requirement. I am greatful to every1 in cytecare.,5
"Went here for my dad..I am writing down my experience over the course of a month..We initially met Dr. Prasad, took a CT at the hospital and he waited to discuss with us on the same day. We were referred to surgeon Dr Kenneth. Dr Kenneth performed specific diagnostics and also he helped to answer for a lot of questions, doubts what typically 1 would get. Prior to surgery his team started educating/helping us. I must mention about Dr. Tshering, who was from the surgery team, was extremely supportive from pre-surgery to post-op till the day of discharge. Although it turned out to be a major surgery than discussed prior, I am really thankful to Dr. Kenneth to have d1 the best of what needs to be d1 for my dad. Thanks a lot Dr. Kenneth, just cant say enough. Attempting a surgery which lasted for 11 hours, you can bet that he is a master in what he does. My dad (67) has almost recovered to the point how he was before surgery and he has recovered good enough to do his daily tasks independently (there are surgery related outcomes but I think we dint have a choice). Also a special note of thanks to the other doctors across departments - Dr. Lokesh, Dr. Anto, Dr. Samyuktha. The management team under Mrs. Rekha, OPD co-ordinator Shreeram , Akshay, physio Reddy Sir all were very supportive too. Overall I am well satisfied with Cytecare's services. Thank you Cytecare !!!",5

"Extremely warm people, right from the doctors and all the staff. Doctors are very good too specially Dr Anthony Pias and his team. Very well maintained hospital. My mother got treated her and doctor Pais and his team helped her recover soon. Thank u??",5
"This response is with reference to Priya Fernandes. Hope she gets to read this :-Having known Dr. Kenneth since many years and many of my friends and loved 1s have received treatment from him. It was very sad to read the review written by Priya. Very hasty judgement and short sighted i must say. Dr.Kenneth as I know is 1 of the few surgical oncologist, who considers all the 3 viz, long term outcome/prognosis, quality of care and cost of treatment , when he makes clinical decisions. Sometimes in Cancer, it is also important to know what not do, than to jump to conclusion and start some treatment immediately.Accurate Diagnosis is the prerequisite to treatment, do not hurry, Every case will require careful scrutiny and assessment, before a surgeon decides to pick his tools. Instead of being angry, you must be happy that he is being so diligent to get your case reviewed by the relevant specialists, so that clinical decision making is not only easy, but correct. He has the most skilled hands of a surgeon, and that is all that is needed for the best surgery to happen. It is important that you are in safe hands for treatment. My best wishes to you.",5
"To All the Staff of Cytecare Hospital,I just wanted to express my thanks and appreciation for the wonderful treatment and care you all showed to me following my recent Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) treatment.Before I came into hospital for the treatment, I was very nervous and daunted by the fear of the unknown but you were all so kind and reassuring when I arrived which took away a lot of my apprehension.Id like to particularly thank Dr. HARI MENON and his team for their expertise in the medication from day 1 till end of my treatment. There were members of the team whom I saw on a daily basis and whom I became particularly close to during my stay in the hospital.However, Id also like to thank all the other people (Dietician team, Support and administrative team, Security team), too numerous to mention who all played such an important part in my treatment and recovery.Also would like to thank Mrs. Mili Barua for educating breathing exercise (Deep breathing, Count breathing, Sadanta Pranayama, DRT) during my stay in the hospitalNow, I am recovering and it has happened only because of your medication. I am sure will be fine and running soon.I, once again, would like to express my gratefulness towards your kindness and generosity for all your care and support",5
"The best cancer speciality hospital in Bangalore. The team at Cytecare are through professionals. Dr. Hari Menon is the best Haemotologist in the country & practices here. Also, a huge shout out to other amazing doctors - Dr. Raghavendra, Dr. Amelia, & Dr. Ajay Rao. Michelle, Mili, Prema, Madhu, Manujith, Purnima & all the Nurses and staff in OPD & the wards are Amazing!!!",5
"My name is Philip Kipserem Sitienei. I am from Eldoret, Kenya and I came to Cytecare Hospitals Bangalore for oncological medical treatment. The experience was great due to the good reception from our NHIF agents led by Mr. Shivjith Shetty, Mr. Rowlin Mathias and Mr. Rakheesh. They were examplary. The Doctors both Hari Menon and Prasad Narayanan are of exceptional experience in the understanding to the patient's need and requirements during and after management.The hospital, support staff in general are too concerned. We felt more at home while at Cytecare and happy to have chosen Cytecare Bangalore we wish them all the best and may you continue giving your expertise to the needy. We promise to share the knowledge we have now about your great management to the people back at home(Kenya). Thank you very much for your management and our stay here was worthwhile. God bless Cytecare Hospitals Bangalore.",5
SANTOSH GOWDA from vijayapura Bangalore I visited Cyte care hospital 2/5/2018 for general check up mouth cancer....i met Dr Girish shettar & I felt like my home environment such a experienced surgeon who treated very patience and he guided me very positively....coool minded....good to see like this hospitals in this curupted modern era..... Overall I felt happy with the doctor who made me feel happy of my rest of future life...thank you Dr Girish shettar & the hole staff of Cyte care hospital Bangalore......i loved ????,5
"My experience at Cytecare has been an extremely satisfying 1.Their holistic approach in treating cancer is exactly what we wanted. The personal care and concern from the doctors especially Dr Ajay Rao and Narayan Prasad, to the nurses from the administrative staff to every attendants, is truly commendable.I can never forget the navigators specialy Mili, Asha and Mira who were constantly by our side talking 1 through the ordeal. Pain and palliative department under Dr Raghavendra taking care any difficulty or pain and making the journey so much easier.The nutrition department especially Esther who not only custom makes your diet but also updates with follow ups.We are very Happy we chose cytecare.",5
"Very nice hospital. Highly recommend. Fantastic doctors with the best bedside manner ( missing in today's healthcare).Nutrition department under Esther is really good. As a care giver I was able to observe how customised the menu is. Most hospitals give a standard meal. Here the nutrition department is actively involved in meeting each patient and talking to them on a daily basis, understanding their needs and changing the menu accordingly. Food is brought on time at regular intervals depending on the nutritional needs of each patient. It's not good to fall ill or to be diagnosed with cancer but if you want to feel at home despite all the mental turmoil...this is the best place to be in Bangalore. We got very good treatment from the CEO to the cleaning staff and security....everybody is empathetic and so courteous. Nursing staff is also 1 of the best ....efficient and totally professional .",5

"Cytecare has an amazingly well qualified team of doctors. Also with their wonderful social initiatives, there are on a mission to touch as many lives as they can. We had referred to Dr Hari Menon on their team for my mother's MM case. As the patient was not from Blr, Dr Menon went out of his way to give a detailed reply to the queries we posted to him on email and guided us to the best possible treatment options and its pros and cons. With such a committed team, Cytecare indeed has a bright future and its patients are in safe hands.",5

Besides its proactive medical and administrative staff, the Hospital is equipped with State of art facilities to ensure availability of latest technology to its patients.The most striking feature of this hospital that I noticed was warmth. Right from my entering the hospital I never felt like coming to a place where people dont really like to come unless forced by the need for medical treatment. I indeed felt like coming to a place well known to me and in a welcoming environment, right from the security staff wearing pleasing smiles and courteously saying Namaste to the administrative staff ready to make me feel comfortable , to the professional and positive approach of attending doctor and his team and finally to the excellent hospitalisation and nursing facilities.I wish my very best to the hospital in its sincere and relentless pursuit to achieve higher standard of excellence in dispensing high quality treatment.",5

"Our experience with Cytecare cancer Hospitals is beyond words and it is a heartful feeling. Infact our family was in a lost situation when we were already recovering from a trauma that happened to us last year and again when it comes to Mom we were unable to decide what to do next?Last december my Mom was completely bed ridden and diagonosed with stage 3 B Plasma cell Leukemia.We were told by a leading cancer treatment hospital chain to take her home as they do not have a definite prognosis for her treatment.Its a God sent message through my friend about Cytecare and Dr Hari Menon .With his treatment plan and Therapy which we are continuing for a year now, she has got the a immense control of her disease. We saw a drastic change in her health and quality of life after her hospital stay and treatment. I feel very proud that we could give her the best world class treatment in Bangalore in an affordable cost. More over she feels so good and comfortable with the entire hospital atmosphere and nursing staffs as all of them wear a smile always. More than anything, she had recieved a lot courage and good will to fight the disease. Dr Hari Menon spends lot of time with each patient and make them feel like a normal person and discuss the disease and treatment plan with patience and positive attitude towards life.For her he is the motivation factor!The Hospital takes care of the over all well being of the patient which includes Home based physiotherapy, Nursing facility,Nutritional diet plan specially meant for cancer patients,emergency vehicles and lot more services which many hospitals not even thought of. Cytecare has a very good ambience and Infrastructure and we do not feel that you are in a hospital. I take pride in walking with my mom during hospital visits when she says no to the wheel chair facility and says she can walk al1!Cytecare like Multi organ cancer speciality hospital is a boon to many common people who do not know much about the disease and its treatment potential, available today in Bangalore. They have dealt and seen enough with this scary word 'Cancer 'and all the doctors are well experienced in thier own speciality.Any time of my life, we are always Thankful to Cytecare , We got our Mom back to life !We could see her smiling yet bold face again.Thank you my friend for introducing Hari sir and Cytecare to us and helped us see the ray of hope for more healthy years to come!",5
Good hospital good staff we are from bangladesh and they have helped us in the admission prospect and doctor is also very niceWe are glad to be in this place for treatment and I.Will tell to other people to come here for their treatment,5

The person whom i met first was Ms Sobana(coordinator) who explained us about all the expenditure and because of her we felt like we should go ahead.she took us to another personal coordinator Ms Sunita who used to take appointment for us and used to collect reports and all.Both of these ladies were very very polite and cooperative.They are doing their job in a very well manner..My experience with this hospital is tremendously good.Right from the security staff to senior doctors each and every person is too humble.Team of Doctors Dr Mohan keshavamurthy,Dr.Shakir ,Dr Mohan BA and Dr.shreyas were very approachable and used to explain the entire process in a very easy way.All the doctors were very polite to us despite of our so many queries .ICU staff is doing too gud as well.Thanks a lot entire team.My mother is fine now.",5

"My Father is alive only because of Allah and Efforts of Cytecare hospital staff. Here is my detailed review about my 10 days stay at cytecare hospital.We shifted my father to Cytecare hospital with my friend reference. Because treatment of earlier hospital M* ******h was not satisfactory there was no improvement after spending 900000 INR.At Cytecare our case discussed in Board Room Meeting with efficient Doctors like Dr. Prasad, Dr. Kenneth and Dr. Dinesh-(Super Star of Cytecare of hospital). We felt very happy after consulting with them and my father Gastrectomy was planned on next week.Unfortunately my father suffered severe hematemesis (Blood Vomit-tings), we rushed our father to hospital in early morning hours of 5 AM to hospital, his BP was fallen to 44/67 and but he was struggling to life and death.I was very happy and shocked to see all the relevant doctors arrived to hospital on SUNDAY within 1 hour time Dr. Dinesh (Super Star), Dr. Kenneth, Dr. Vinod and other Doctors, they planned for immediate surgery which was high risk L13. All the doctors explained me the risk of surgery with complete protocols of SAVING MY FATHER. I have been visiting multi specialty hospitals from last 10 years in India and abroad, never got to see doctors coming in on SUNDAY and saving lifes.My Father condition was (Diabetic, BP was 44/67, Anemic HB 6.7 and symptoms of TB as well). Grace Allah and Doctors efforts Surgery was successful, During and after time surgery Doctors always said that My Father is recovering and responding very well (Best Humility part is: They never and said that we are doing our best). In ICU also it was state-of-the-art care was given by Nurses, Orthopedic Dr. and Head Nurse. They deserve big reward.Special Thanks to Dr. Kenneth and His team.Thanks ton to Dr. Dinesh - He is best motivator to my father and myself I call him Super Star of Cytecare Hospital.I would love to write about supporting staff:Billing Department: Rekha and her team (Yashas, Lakshmi, Komal Singh and 2 people sits in ICU ward in night shift)They were always kind and helped us out understanding How much was current detail bill, expected bill and current bills. We have been informed by them very transparently and without any ambiguity.Nursing Staff: Nursing staff were very agile, very caring and always gave my dad best of confidence to recover faster. They took of my father as small baby.Housekeeping: Especially Mr. Santhosh charismatic speaker he always gave me new dimensions to think on trust and care A big thank you to Mr. Santhosh Sir (A guy with spectacles). His staff was also well responded to the call of duty without any hesitation, they were very contained and committed to work. Never showed us influence gifting something to them, it is never the case in other hospitals. Thank you Santhosh for keeping me motivated in my difficult time of life.Security: Mr. Srinivas is super man of cytecare hospital though I just had 5 minutes interaction in elevator. His security personnel was so down to earth they always wished us 2 hands folded Namasthe which reliver of stress. Security at cytecare is very punctual, kind and h1st in showing us directions of wards, helping us in understanding hospital exit, parking and other procedures. Every1 was respected us with their utmost behavior and attitude.These are my heartfelt reviews to CYTECARE hospital, In every family father is head of the family: Thanks a ton for making our family alive once again.",5
Took my mother in law for cancer treatment and we are extremely pleased with the services and support offered.The doctors are very well qualified and courteous and took us through the procedures in detail.The staff are also very well behaved and provide top notch customer service.The hospital is well maintained and very clean.We recommend the hospital to others for the above reasons.Keep it up Cytecare and the whole team associated with it!,5
"My 79 year old father was admitted at Cytecare after we carefully considered all options and othercancer centers for treatment care. We have been wowed by the professional and personable staff who care for my dad so well with so much love, energy and passion for cancer patient care.I personally have spent a lot of time in the USA consulting with the worlds best cancer treatment centers like Mayo Clinic and I find the Cytecare docs especially Dr Raghavendra and his team, equally knowledgeable, care standards top class and they are very responsive to both the patient�s needs as well as my family�s wishes and concerns.My mother was the primary care giver staying with my dad 24/7 and she had forgotten her own medications, the staff was so kind to go get her medicine from a pharmacy simply because she could not leave the bed side of my father.In summary, we have been very satisfied with the treatment and service, if this helps another family and patient make up their mind on getting treatment at this hospital, I highly recommend Cytecare.",5
"Here to say a few positive things I noticited in the hospitalIt has a beautiful atmosphere andStaff from the security levell are very polite and humble. Thanks to Mr Srnivas for the excellent security serviceRooms and corridors are very hyginic.My husband was reffered by Dr Anthony Pais . Dr Prasad Narayanan is very professional and inspires confidence . Dr Harish, Dr Feba, Dr Senthamarai are polite and humbleWith reference to the Navigator Mili Baruah who is very cheerful and bubbly brings a breath of fresh air into cytecare.Special thanks to billing deprtment names I would like to mention Prema, Madhu and Varsha and last but not the least Ms Rekha who comes across as a very able administrator .We would like to thank all of you for making our stay very confortable",5
"""My mom was undergoing treatment for multiple growths without much results at the """"so called renowned Cancer hospital"""" at Bangalore ie HCG. There wasn't much of help and they had given us 3 months time after forcing multiple surgeries upon us. We had finished the 1st surgery (removal of breast tumour) and were proceeding to the next (Colo rectal surgery). Needless to say she was suffering every day and we were running pillar to post within HCG.. Who weren't responsive to the critical situationI heard of Cytecare and was totally astounded by the immediate response of the medical team that assured me that she doesn't have to undergo surgery and they have advanced alternative treatments to help her handle the growth that was there in liver and colorectal area",with traces in lungsDr Prasad Narayanan and his wonderful team aided with Palliative department started immediate treatment and 3 months into it

A referral was made to Cytecare hospital. Since arriving here. They haven't disappointed. Courteous staffs, clean eenvironment, Doctors who are very certain of their activities and machinery to support them too. During the admission, the wards are very clean, comfortable and delicious food served on time and right temperature. You can never go wrong with Cytecare Cancer Hospital, Bangalore.",5
"I want to do health checkup and screening, i got to know this hospital from google and i g1 thru the google review and feedback. Based on the review comments, i decided to go this hospital. This hospital is little far from my location. But it is best hospital I have ever seen. All the staff is very professional, helpful and courteous. Especially day care person Ms. Soumee, her cooperation and assistance help me lot for entire screening section from morning to evening. I want to thank, her cooperation and coordination. I recommend whoever wants to go, not to hesitate just step forward.",4
"Dr. Prasad Narayanan is a wonderful Doctor. The admin staff is great, Akash and the team. The Nurses in the procedure room and Chemo suite are experienced and take good care of the patients. It has been a great experience so far at Cyte Care. The hospital could improve on the discharge process as it takes time inspite of the efforts of the admin staff.",4
Very very bad existencee.... Very unprofessional... Doctors don't care about people waiting... They love chit chatting with there people and have no professionalism... They take appointments but they don't care whose waiting.. Very good lying... They say doctors are in rounds but fixture are not even in the hospital because they are stuck in traffic.. Totally insane right .. you'll step ito with same feeling..,2
"What a pathetic hospital , they can't manage it .only they know hang around tea shop.dont go for cancer screening.they dont care.",1
Pathetically managed.. We came here at 11am for woman cancer screening but it was wrong decision. They dont have dedicated staff to handle Health check up. All staff leave there place and enjoy tea cofee at counter. You will see patients suffer they enjoy the AC. Lots of staff but no solutions. They hang around.they did not complete the procedure said doctors are busy. Dont go there. Apollo and Manipal are better place. This pelole only look for party whom they can change after that they dont care.,1
"Good service and good staff facility, professional doctors, I recommend whoever wants to go, not to hesitate just step forward",5
"I had a mixed experience in this hospital..It has very excellent medical team,the Doctors,nurses,patient care..note I had some sessions on chemo,surgery and radiotherapy..never was I disappointed by any team..the Navigators keep you informed and the psycho oncologist keeps your nerves calmMy greatest disappointment which I h1stly wouldn't hide was to do with the billing and the team that handles international patients..this team gives you a lot of stress when it comes to payment issues..note you leave your country ready to meet your hospital bills..won't mention much of my odeal with them but management should game up on this..They will hike the bills...Bill you for services not given....They will want you to deposit as much dollars as you can and it's hustle getting your balance back..They will want to tag you to a certain blocker much as you were just a walk in or a referal to a particular doctor..too much stress..customer care not good.Well because of the good doctors and nursing team I will always come for my reviews but will be extra careful with the customer care and the billing staff..I Am sorry but this had to come out",4
"Excellent hospital. The doctors here are very much on top of their subject which you can sense with their confidence in the dealings . Here i would make a very special mention of my surgeon Dr Kenneth Dcruz whom i cannot thank enough for treating me with his exemplary standards .They also try their best to keep the patient well informed of the issue and various treatment options. The hospital is very neat clean and hygenic work a very decent canteen as well. The private ward is very comfortable with adequate luxury. you get the feeling that a lot of thought has been put to get the design of the hospital very thorough. Last but never the least the nurses, various other care taking staff , various admin all were not only adept at work but really happy to help which was so evident in their body language , and makes the stay feel like being at home. All in all I would say cytecare is a benchmark of a hospital. It's primarily a cancer treatment hospital but can do other surgical procedures as well which can be made known . thanks for your service and keep up the good work",5
The hospital is best for cancer. I also cure here. There Doctor and stuff very well.,5
"I went there with a lot of apprehension. You know when you enter a Cancer hospital as patient it is kind of scarry. But right from the watchman at the gate, the receptionist and all who followed had such beautiful smiles that I felt at ease. I was lucky too that there was nothing wrong with me. Dr. Pius was so attentive and so was Dr Mukta. Gems all of them. Thanks so much.",5

"Professional and efficient staff, functioning with a smile (20/10/18).Thoughtful enough to hand me a bottle of water.

WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN STAYING CONSISTENT.",5

"Cancer never gives a warning before invading the patient�s body and their lives. When my mother was diagnosed with Cancer in Nov 2016 she was already on a high stage of her cancer. I had to start her treatment immediately so I hardly had a lot of time to start searching for doctors or hospital. After 2 cycles of chemo when the situation was a bit under control and I started my research of finding the right doctor, better hospital for her further treatment. I was introduced to Cytecare by a friend in Dec 2016.From my very first interaction with their Senior Consultant: Medical Oncologist Dr. Prasad Narayan (from treatment & diagnosis POV) & their Hospital Administration Head Ms. Rehka Shivakumar (from hospitalisation POV) I got the confidence that there are hospitals and doctors in India that think of patients� care first & help patients� family to take informed decisions. At Cytecare I felt the approach towards treating the patient is holistic and comprehensive. They not only maintain higher treatment standards and follows protocols but also maintain a very high level of integrity.Each time, my mother had to to admited in ward or in day care I felt that her doctor�s and nursing/support team�s approach toward her gave her a lot more confidence to fight back and feel good from within. I strongly believe a lively, hygienic & comfortable environment helps patients a lot emotionally to fight back their illness, especially something like Cancer that has already created a huge amount to anxiety within the patient and the family. Cytecare provides just the right environment.And at times I have felt they have g1 beyond expectation ?? � thank you so much!From my experience since last 2 years I can say 1 thing for sure that each doctor (especially Dr. Prasad Narayan & Dr. Roopesh N), Patient counseling team (especially Meera Ma�m & Mili), Supporting medical team (Psycho Onco - Michelle, Dietitian - Mou), Nursing team, Ward Care teams, Billing & other Admin teams (Rekha & her team - Sunil, Vasanth, Shreerama & others), Radiation team (Dr. Ajay Rao & Dr. Vijetha Jayakumar), every1 been very supportive. Each and every member I ever had interaction with felt that they have the right sensibility and empathy towards the patient and their family.I am grateful how they have been taking care of my mother in the last 2 years.",5
"Treatment n services are amazing , Doctors Caretakers n admin have helped a lot in every process.Thanks a lot to the entire team .",5
"Very happy with everything,Doctors,staffs cleanliness name it .It�s just awesome, God bless",5
"Cytecare is not a hospital,It is home away from home so well managed. All staff members are self motivated at all levels attending to the patients round the clock (security housekeeping,customcare,nursing staff,F&B)The navigators-Ms Milli ,Ms Asha,Mrs Meera were awesome they made the situation so easy to accept by their continues interaction with us.Not forgetting the nutritionist Dr Esther who adviced and constantly followed up with our diety requirement .Special mention of the young Dr Povamma who is outstanding,charming and made things so simple for the family to accept and handle the situation .Wish all the members of cytecare all the best and a big thankq to all for attending my relative who was undergoing the treatment in this hospital .",5
I'm taking treatment for ALL from Dr.Hari Menon.He's 1 of the best doctors in oncology.Excellent treatment and facilities.Nursing staff are very compassionate and supportive.

"I am Mrs Elaine Lewis 71 years of age. I was diagnosed with breast cancer by Dr. Kenneth D�Cruz. As I had g1 to Dr. Kenneth D�Cruz for a hernia check-up he had asked me to do a few teats and a CT scan, which shown a lump in the breast.I was referred to Dr. Anthony Pais of Cytecare Cancer hospital by Dr. Kenneth. If not for Dr. Kenneth D�Cruz I would have not known that I have breast cancer and I am so grateful and thankful to him. I also visited him at his clinic many times but he did not take his consultations fee. May God bless him & his family for all the good work he is doing.When I visited Cytecare Cancer hospital and met Dr. Anthony Pais and after a couple of tests he confirmed breast cancer and advised me for a surgery. Dr. Anthony Pais along with his team of doctors made me feel very safe and comfortable in the operation theatre and the ward.After 1 month of the surgery I started chemo as advised by Dr. Prasad Narayanan. During my chemo treatment which lasted for 12 weeks. Dr. Prasad Narayanan made me feel very comfortable and would visit me every time the chemo treatment was going on. I still go to him for checkups and I must thank Dr. Prasad Narayanan and the doctors & Staff of the day-care centre.I would like to thank Dr. Anthony Pais, Dr. Prasad Narayanan, Dr. Kenneth D�Cruz and all the doctors & staff of Cytecare cancer hospital. May God bless each 1, my prayers will always be for them.I advise any1 with any sign cancer to please go to Cytecare Cancer hospital and I assure you of the best treatment & love.Elaine Lewis",5
The place is better then other hospitals and the doctor's give time to their patients making them feel comfortable and they give treatment keeping the patience comfort in mind.,4
"Having diagnosed with Breast cancer and looking for a place of treatment, I chanced upon Cytecare and took the chance. I am so glad I did. I met Dr. Anthony Pais and I knew I had come to the right place.Dr. Prasad Narayanan and Dr. Anthony Pais were the best team I could ask for to help me make it through. They re-defined normal for me and broke all the mental shackles I could have had regarding cancer. 1 word � brilliant� I was working through the entire treatment and living a normal life � thanks to them treating me so normal and never allowing me to feel bad for myself or feel any different.The day care staff are awesome individuals who resonate so much positive energy that chemotherapy felt like a walk in the park. Yes I am making it sound simple but truly, they made it so simple for me. Smiling faces I would meet and smile through the day. For my surgery, I was in hospital for 2 weeks and the attention and care I got was very good. Treatment is their top priority but there is absolutely no compromise on the mental well -being of the patient. During this phase, a big focus is diet and nutrition � I haven�t seen any hospital emphasizing on this so much. Esther is like a genie who was constantly moderating my nutrition need and ensuring I was being fed happy food while keeping my treatment in mind. I found many happy souls who not only helped in me this journey but have become friends � Michelle and Mili are 2 of them. I have to mention the help staff who do their duty with so much love and dedication. Special mention to Suresh Ramu- CEO who is so hands on and probably that is why this hospital is so different from any other healthcare institution.Today I have finished my treatment and I have the entire staff to thank � from those at the reception to the doctors, nurse and help staff. Every1 in this hospital is such a giving person that they make you feel comforted and happy through this journey",4
"Visited Cytecare hospital,bangalore for my mother in law's treatment. Glad to have visited as I was able to understand the illness better. Kudos !!! to the front office team who coordinated doctor's appointment and all billing details would like to specially appreciate Akash Ravindran for all the support for coordinating with the lab for us to have received reports.",5
Should give zero review to this hospital. only m1y making . We just went for a second opinion from Dr Kenneth Dcruz. Never met such a doctor who just took 2 seconds to read the report and said not possible. We requested him to see the CT scan CD (which he can see from his monitor) but he referred 1 more doctor Radiologist and 1 more for general physician. each doctor have their own fees . We came with our problem and that doctor is just in making m1y. Never visit this hospital they just suck m1y as blood and make people to die. I dont know how they are getting this waste reviews. I went by reviews please dont make such mistake. Seeing the sad face of Dr Kenneth Dcruz never feel like patients can have any suggestion to live further happily.,1
"Cytecare Hospital is a very good hospital for.cancer, also it has a very helpful staff.I'd like to say thank you",5

"Hi, this is Kokila. Whoever is reading this review might be because you or some1 whom you love/care is diagnosed with Cancer. Well, you are in the right place.You must be going through lot of confusion on deciding where to get the treatment d1, which doctor to approach, will I get right treatment and so on. Since, I have g1 through this confusion, during my initial days of my diagnosis, I am writing below review, which might help you to get some answers to your questions.As most of you know already, for any cancer treatment, the common protocol followed by most hospitals, is chemo, surgery and radiation. But, it is important to choose right medication with appropriate dosage and that can be d1 only by proper analysis of disease by best team doctors, including Medical Oncologist, Surgeons, Pain management, Radiologist and rest of doctors.In my case, I was lucky to get in contact with Dr. Prasad Narayan, who did thorough analysis of my situation and exploring best chemo medication available in the market, appropriate for my case. As my situation was very complicated, he evaluated multiple opinions from various senior doctors on our behalf, to give best solution. His knowledge, patience and caring nature has helped get my disease, in control. Thanks to him and I would say, he is best Medical oncologist in Bangalore.Talking about cancer treatment, it is not only about medication targeting the tumor, but it is side effects of medications and pain we have to deal with the tumor. I was going through great deal of pain and approached multiple doctors in city, but no 1 could get me the relief, from my pain. At last, I got reference to Dr. Ragavendra and his experience in pain management proved to be best in my case. He treated my case with such an intense of care with right medication, dosage and procedures to attack the root cause of my pain. He works closely with individuals to patiently listen to the problem and provides the best pain management solutions. It is rare to find such a passionate, h1st and patient centric professional.I would also appreciate the support provided by Radiologists Dr. Muktha and Dr. Nagraj for their thorough analysis of the disease through appropriate scan and reports. They both have immense knowledge in field and are guiding the Surgeons and Oncologists to provide best care to patients.Last but not the least; I want to thank the nursing staff, who played critical role in giving comfort and care during the chemotherapy cycles. With all the pain, I was going through, their smile and care, was very comforting.Past 1 and half year, which I spent in fighting this horrifying disease, Cytecare team of doctors, nursing and other staff, stood by my side and helped me get out of this tough phase of my life. I am very grateful for their support and care.Thank you Cytecare team. Please continue to provide best care, support and cure to many more patients.",5
Highly recommended ..efficient doctors and staff,5
Cytecare has been a saviour of my condition since 2018 when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer.Dr. Poovamma has not just been a surgeon treating my condition but always a pillar of support guiding me through this long journey of my recovery. Thank you to all the support staff at Cytecare who have always made me feel at home during this journey. Every staff irrespective of their different job profile was always there to attend to any requirement. I am greatful to every1 in cytecare.,5
"Went here for my dad..I am writing down my experience over the course of a month..We initially met Dr. Prasad, took a CT at the hospital and he waited to discuss with us on the same day. We were referred to surgeon Dr Kenneth. Dr Kenneth performed specific diagnostics and also he helped to answer for a lot of questions, doubts what typically 1 would get. Prior to surgery his team started educating/helping us. I must mention about Dr. Tshering, who was from the surgery team, was extremely supportive from pre-surgery to post-op till the day of discharge. Although it turned out to be a major surgery than discussed prior, I am really thankful to Dr. Kenneth to have d1 the best of what needs to be d1 for my dad. Thanks a lot Dr. Kenneth, just cant say enough. Attempting a surgery which lasted for 11 hours, you can bet that he is a master in what he does. My dad (67) has almost recovered to the point how he was before surgery and he has recovered good enough to do his daily tasks independently (there are surgery related outcomes but I think we dint have a choice). Also a special note of thanks to the other doctors across departments - Dr. Lokesh, Dr. Anto, Dr. Samyuktha. The management team under Mrs. Rekha, OPD co-ordinator Shreeram , Akshay, physio Reddy Sir all were very supportive too. Overall I am well satisfied with Cytecare's services. Thank you Cytecare !!!",5

"Am grateful to Cut-rate as my father got treated and received a very good care from the whole cytecare team including the doctors, nurses, administration.We are happy to recommend it to all needy people and my comment is to KEEP IT UP.",5
"Extremely warm people, right from the doctors and all the staff. Doctors are very good too specially Dr Anthony Pias and his team. Very well maintained hospital. My mother got treated her and doctor Pais and his team helped her recover soon. Thank u??",5
"This response is with reference to Priya Fernandes. Hope she gets to read this :-Having known Dr. Kenneth since many years and many of my friends and loved 1s have received treatment from him. It was very sad to read the review written by Priya. Very hasty judgement and short sighted i must say. Dr.Kenneth as I know is 1 of the few surgical oncologist, who considers all the 3 viz, long term outcome/prognosis, quality of care and cost of treatment , when he makes clinical decisions. Sometimes in Cancer, it is also important to know what not do, than to jump to conclusion and start some treatment immediately.Accurate Diagnosis is the prerequisite to treatment, do not hurry, Every case will require careful scrutiny and assessment, before a surgeon decides to pick his tools. Instead of being angry, you must be happy that he is being so diligent to get your case reviewed by the relevant specialists, so that clinical decision making is not only easy, but correct. He has the most skilled hands of a surgeon, and that is all that is needed for the best surgery to happen. It is important that you are in safe hands for treatment. My best wishes to you.",5
"To All the Staff of Cytecare Hospital,I just wanted to express my thanks and appreciation for the wonderful treatment and care you all showed to me following my recent Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) treatment.Before I came into hospital for the treatment, I was very nervous and daunted by the fear of the unknown but you were all so kind and reassuring when I arrived which took away a lot of my apprehension.I�d like to particularly thank Dr. HARI MENON and his team for their expertise in the medication from day 1 till end of my treatment. There were members of the team whom I saw on a daily basis and whom I became particularly close to during my stay in the hospital.However, I�d also like to thank all the other people (Dietician team, Support and administrative team, Security team), too numerous to mention who all played such an important part in my treatment and recovery.Also would like to thank Mrs. Mili Barua for educating breathing exercise (Deep breathing, Count breathing, Sadanta Pranayama, DRT) during my stay in the hospitalNow, I am recovering and it has happened only because of your medication. I am sure will be fine and running soon.I, once again, would like to express my gratefulness towards your kindness and generosity for all your care and support",5
"The best cancer speciality hospital in Bangalore. The team at Cytecare are through professionals. Dr. Hari Menon is the best Haemotologist in the country & practices here. Also, a huge shout out to other amazing doctors - Dr. Raghavendra, Dr. Amelia, & Dr. Ajay Rao. Michelle, Mili, Prema, Madhu, Manujith, Purnima & all the Nurses and staff in OPD & the wards are Amazing!!!",5
"My name is Philip Kipserem Sitienei. I am from Eldoret, Kenya and I came to Cytecare Hospitals Bangalore for oncological medical treatment. The experience was great due to the good reception from our NHIF agents led by Mr. Shivjith Shetty, Mr. Rowlin Mathias and Mr. Rakheesh. They were examplary. The Doctors both Hari Menon and Prasad Narayanan are of exceptional experience in the understanding to the patient's need and requirements during and after management.The hospital, support staff in general are too concerned. We felt more at home while at Cytecare and happy to have chosen Cytecare Bangalore we wish them all the best and may you continue giving your expertise to the needy. We promise to share the knowledge we have now about your great management to the people back at home(Kenya). Thank you very much for your management and our stay here was worthwhile. God bless Cytecare Hospitals Bangalore.",5
SANTOSH GOWDA from vijayapura Bangalore I visited Cyte care hospital 2/5/2018 for general check up mouth cancer....i met Dr Girish shettar & I felt like my home environment such a experienced surgeon who treated very patience and he guided me very positively....coool minded....good to see like this hospitals in this curupted modern era..... Overall I felt happy with the doctor who made me feel happy of my rest of future life...thank you Dr Girish shettar & the hole staff of Cyte care hospital Bangalore......i loved ????,5
"My experience at Cytecare has been an extremely satisfying 1.Their holistic approach in treating cancer is exactly what we wanted. The personal care and concern from the doctors especially Dr Ajay Rao and Narayan Prasad, to the nurses from the administrative staff to every attendants, is truly commendable.I can never forget the navigators specialy Mili, Asha and Mira who were constantly by our side talking 1 through the ordeal. Pain and palliative department under Dr Raghavendra taking care any difficulty or pain and making the journey so much easier.The nutrition department especially Esther who not only custom makes your diet but also updates with follow ups.We are very Happy we chose cytecare.",5
"Very nice hospital. Highly recommend. Fantastic doctors with the best bedside manner ( missing in today's healthcare).Nutrition department under Esther is really good. As a care giver I was able to observe how customised the menu is. Most hospitals give a standard meal. Here the nutrition department is actively involved in meeting each patient and talking to them on a daily basis, understanding their needs and changing the menu accordingly. Food is brought on time at regular intervals depending on the nutritional needs of each patient. It's not good to fall ill or to be diagnosed with cancer but if you want to feel at home despite all the mental turmoil...this is the best place to be in Bangalore. We got very good treatment from the CEO to the cleaning staff and security....everybody is empathetic and so courteous. Nursing staff is also 1 of the best ....efficient and totally professional .",5

All the care and care from the administrators, doctors, and all the workers. Good reception. And the best services.

"Cytecare has an amazingly well qualified team of doctors. Also with their wonderful social initiatives, there are on a mission to touch as many lives as they can. We had referred to Dr Hari Menon on their team for my mother's MM case. As the patient was not from Blr, Dr Menon went out of his way to give a detailed reply to the queries we posted to him on email and guided us to the best possible treatment options and its pros and cons. With such a committed team, Cytecare indeed has a bright future and its patients are in safe hands.",5

"First of all I would like to extend warm felicitations to the dynamic management of Cytecare Hospital Banglore for completing 1 year of successful performance.I am personally thankful to the hospital, it�s dedicated staff and responsible management for my satisfactory and fruitful treatment at this hospital. Besides its proactive medical and administrative staff, the Hospital is equipped with State of art facilities to ensure availability of latest technology to its patients.The most striking feature of this hospital that I noticed was warmth. Right from my entering the hospital I never felt like coming to a place where people don�t really like to come unless forced by the need for medical treatment. I indeed felt like coming to a place well known to me and in a welcoming environment, right from the security staff wearing pleasing smiles and courteously saying �Namaste� to the administrative staff ready to make me feel comfortable , to the professional and positive approach of attending doctor and his team and finally to the excellent hospitalisation and nursing facilities.I wish my very best to the hospital in its sincere and relentless pursuit to achieve higher standard of excellence in dispensing high quality treatment.",5

"Our experience with Cytecare cancer Hospitals is beyond words and it is a heartful feeling. Infact our family was in a lost situation when we were already recovering from a trauma that happened to us last year and again when it comes to Mom we were unable to decide what to do next?Last december my Mom was completely bed ridden and diagonosed with stage 3 B Plasma cell Leukemia.We were told by a leading cancer treatment hospital chain to take her home as they do not have a definite prognosis for her treatment.Its a God sent message through my friend about Cytecare and Dr Hari Menon .With his treatment plan and Therapy which we are continuing for a year now, she has got the a immense control of her disease. We saw a drastic change in her health and quality of life after her hospital stay and treatment. I feel very proud that we could give her the best world class treatment in Bangalore in an affordable cost. More over she feels so good and comfortable with the entire hospital atmosphere and nursing staffs as all of them wear a smile always. More than anything, she had recieved a lot courage and good will to fight the disease. Dr Hari Menon spends lot of time with each patient and make them feel like a normal person and discuss the disease and treatment plan with patience and positive attitude towards life.For her he is the motivation factor!The Hospital takes care of the over all well being of the patient which includes Home based physiotherapy, Nursing facility,Nutritional diet plan specially meant for cancer patients,emergency vehicles and lot more services which many hospitals not even thought of. Cytecare has a very good ambience and Infrastructure and we do not feel that you are in a hospital. I take pride in walking with my mom during hospital visits when she says no to the wheel chair facility and says she can walk al1!Cytecare like Multi organ cancer speciality hospital is a boon to many common people who do not know much about the disease and its treatment potential, available today in Bangalore. They have dealt and seen enough with this scary word 'Cancer 'and all the doctors are well experienced in thier own speciality.Any time of my life, we are always Thankful to Cytecare , We got our Mom back to life !We could see her smiling yet bold face again.Thank you my friend for introducing Hari sir and Cytecare to us and helped us see the ray of hope for more healthy years to come!",5
